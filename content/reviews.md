# Book reviews

Below is a collection of book reviews that I have posted - click the links to go to the full review.

1.  Adam Alter's [Irresistible: Why We Can't Stop Checking,
        Scrolling, Clicking and
        Watching](http://jasoncollins.blog/2017/10/05/alters-irresistible-why-we-cant-stop-checking-scrolling-clicking-and-watching/): a
        well-written and entertaining book about a subject I don’t know
        much about (addiction), with one glaring slip.

2.  Dan Ariely’s  [The Honest Truth About Dishonesty: How We Lie to
        Everyone – Especially
        Ourselves](http://jasoncollins.blog/2016/04/22/arielys-the-honest-truth-about-dishonesty/):
        Interesting substance as draws on Ariely's own work, but
        sometimes meanders. Will the results stand the test of time?

3.  Dan Ariely’s [Payoff: The Hidden Logic That Shapes Our
        Motivations](http://jasoncollins.blog/2018/01/31/dan-arielys-payoff-the-hidden-logic-that-shapes-our-motivations/): Enjoyable,
        but not particularly deep read, with most of the results covered
        in [The Upside of
        Irrationality](http://jasoncollins.blog/2013/09/23/arielys-upside-irrationality/).

4.  Dan Ariely's [Predictably
        Irrational](http://jasoncollins.blog/2013/09/02/arielys-predictably-irrational/ "Ariely's Predictably Irrational"):
        Not a bad book for a sample of behavioural economics if you are
        new to the area.

5.  Dan Ariely's [The Upside of
        Irrationality](http://jasoncollins.blog/2013/09/23/arielys-upside-irrationality/ "Ariely's The Upside of Irrationality"):
        Some interesting ideas (particularly early in the book) but
        seems light compared to Predictably Irrational.
6.  Roy Baumeister and John Tierney’s [Willpower: Rediscovery Our
        Greatest
        Strength](http://jasoncollins.blog/2016/07/15/baumeister-and-tierneys-willpower-rediscovering-the-greatest-human-strength/):
        The book tended into the pop science/self-help genre and there
        was rarely enough depth to add anything to the current debates.

7.  Eric Beinhocker's [Origin of Wealth: Evolution, Complexity, and
        the Radical Remaking of
        Economics](http://jasoncollins.blog/2012/04/11/beinhockers-the-origin-of-wealth/ "Beinhocker's The Origin of Wealth"):
        The best readable discussion of the field of "evolutionary
        economics" and the application of complexity theory to
        economics.
8.  Shlomo Benartzi (and Jonah Lehrer’s) [The Smarter Screen:
        Surprising Ways to Influence and Improve Online
        Behaviour](http://jasoncollins.blog/2018/01/10/benartzi-and-lehrers-the-smarter-screen-surprising-ways-to-influence-and-improve-online-behaviour/): Makes
        some interesting points and directed me to plenty of interesting
        material elsewhere. Just don't bet your house on the parade of
        results being right.

9.  Sam Bowles and Herb Gintis's [A Cooperative Species: Human
        Reciprocity and Its
        Evolution](http://jasoncollins.blog/2012/03/26/bowles-and-gintiss-a-cooperative-species/ "Bowles and Gintis's A Cooperative Species"):
        An interesting but unsatisfactory argument for the role of group
        selection in the emergence of cooperation.

10. Robert Boyd and Peter Richerson's [The Origin and Evolution of
        Cultures](http://jasoncollins.blog/2012/11/05/boyd-and-richersons-the-origin-and-evolution-of-cultures/ "Boyd and Richerson's The Origin and Evolution of Cultures"):
        A seminal work on cultural evolution.

11. Rob Brooks’s [Sex, Genes & Rock ‘n’ Roll: How evolution has
        shaped the modern
        world](http://jasoncollins.blog/2011/06/08/brookss-sex-genes-rock-n-roll/ "Brooks's Sex, Genes & Rock 'n' Roll"):
        Obesity, population control, infanticide and rock ‘n’ roll from
        an evolutionary perspective.

12. Janet Browne’s [Charles Darwin:
        Voyaging](http://jasoncollins.blog/2011/02/19/janet-brownes-charles-darwin-voyaging/ "Janet Browne's Charles Darwin: Voyaging"):
        The first part to the best Charles Darwin biography.

13. Susan Cain's [Quiet: The Power of Introverts in a World That
        Can't Stop
        Talking](http://jasoncollins.blog/2018/04/05/susan-cains-quiet-the-power-of-introverts-in-a-world-that-cant-stop-talking/):
        An important point that many of our environments, social
        structures and workplaces are unsuited to "introverts", but
        falls into a degree of cheer-leading and evidence-free
        story-telling.

14. Bryan Caplan's [Selfish Reasons to Have More
        Kids](http://jasoncollins.blog/2011/05/09/caplans-selfish-reasons-to-have-more-kids/ "Caplan's Selfish Reasons to Have More Kids"): Parents
        can relax as there is not much they can do to change their
        children. And since they're easier than you think, why don't you
        have more?

15. Brian Christian and Tom Griffiths's [Algorithms to Live By: The
        Computer Science of Human
        Decisions](http://jasoncollins.blog/2017/01/20/christian-and-griffithss-algorithms-to-live-by-the-computer-science-of-human-decisions/):
        A nice contrast to the competition between perfectly rational
        decision makers and biased humans. Christian and Griffiths's
        decision-making benchmarks are the algorithms developed by
        mathematicians and computer scientists, with decision making
        under uncertainty involving trade-offs between efficiency,
        accuracy and the types of errors you are willing to accept.

16. Gregory Clark's [The Son Also Rises: Surnames and the History of
        Social
        Mobility](http://jasoncollins.blog/2014/09/30/the-genetic-basis-of-social-mobility/ "The genetic basis of social mobility"):
        Social mobility is low across countries and time because there
        is a genetic component to social status.

17. John Coates’s [The Hour Between Dog and Wolf: Risk Taking, Gut
        Feelings and the Biology of Boom and
        Bust](http://jasoncollins.blog/2014/09/04/the-biology-of-boom-and-bust/ "The biology of boom and bust"):
        How our hormones affect decision making in finance - the idea
        that traders are rational calculating machines driven by their
        brains is torn apart.

18. David Colander and Roland Kupers's [Complexity and the Art of
        Public
        Policy](http://jasoncollins.blog/2014/12/29/complexity-and-the-art-of-public-policy/ "Complexity and the Art of Public Policy"):
        An important way to think about policy, even though I'm not
        convinced by many of their proposed applications.

19. Pedro Domingos's [The Master Algorithm: How the Quest for the
        Ultimate Learning Machine Will Remake Our
        World](http://jasoncollins.blog/2017/02/27/domingoss-the-master-algorithm-how-the-quest-for-the-ultimate-learning-machine-will-remake-our-world/):
        Parts verge on techno-Panglossianism. The chapters on the
        various "tribes" of machine learning and learning without
        supervision, are excellent. And I simply don't have the
        knowledge to judge the value of Domingos's reports on his
        progress to the master algorithm.

20. Benoit Dubreuil’s [Human Evolution and the Origins of
        Hierarchies](http://jasoncollins.blog/2011/12/05/dubreuils-human-evolution-and-the-origins-of-hierarchies/ "Dubreuil's Human Evolution and the Origins of Hierarchies"):
        The emergence of modern hierarchies was driven by the cognitive
        changes associated with the behavioural modernisation of human

21. Angela Duckworth’s [Grit: The Power of Passion and
        Perseverance](http://jasoncollins.blog/2018/02/14/angela-duckworths-grit-the-power-of-passion-and-perseverance/):
        Conscientiousness rebadged? Interesting but ignores biology and
        the stories suggest survivorship bias.

22. Niall Ferguson’s [Civilization: The West and the
        Rest](http://jasoncollins.blog/2011/06/20/fergusons-civilization-the-west-and-the-rest/ "Ferguson's Civilization: The West and the Rest"):
        Entertaining and some interesting ideas. Those looking for a
        grand history of everything will be disappointed.

23. James Flynn's [Are We Getting
        Smarter?](http://jasoncollins.blog/2013/02/25/flynns-are-we-getting-smarter/ "Flynn's Are We Getting Smarter?"):
        A comprehensive update on the latest in IQ testing from around
        the globe, plus a few interesting arguments.

24. Robert Franks's [Passions Within Reason: The Strategic Role of the Emotions](http://jasoncollins.blog/2012/06/11/franks-passions-within-reason/ "Frank's Passions Within Reason"):
        A fantastic game theoretic approach to the role of the emotions.

1.  Robert Frank's [Luxury Fever: Weighing the Cost of
        Excess](http://jasoncollins.blog/2012/01/28/franks-luxury-fever/ "Frank's Luxury Fever"):
        People over-consume goods where there is competition for relative rank.

1.  Robert Frank's [The Darwin Economy: Liberty, Competition, and the Common
        Good](http://jasoncollins.blog/2011/10/07/franks-the-darwin-economy/ "Frank's The Darwin Economy"):
        Many aspects of the economy are Darwinian, not Smithian.

2.  Paul Frijters with Gigi Foster's [An Economic Theory of Greed,
        Love, Groups and
        Networks](http://jasoncollins.blog/2013/08/05/an-economic-theory-of-greed-love-groups-and-networks/ "An Economic Theory of Greed, Love, Groups, and Networks"):
        An attempt to supplement mainstream economic arguments with a perspective on love, groups and networks. I don't buy into many of the arguments, but one of the most interesting books I have read.

3.  Francis Fukuyama’s [The Origins of Political Order: From
        Prehuman Times to the French
        Revolution](http://jasoncollins.blog/2011/11/19/fukuyamas-the-origins-of-political-order/ "Fukuyama's The Origins of Political Order"):
        A grand history with self-interest as a motivating factor of the
        individual actor.

4.  Arthur Gandolfi, Anna Sachko Gandolfi and David P.
        Barash's [Economics as an Evolutionary Science: From Utility to
        Fitness](http://jasoncollins.blog/2012/05/02/gandolfi-gandolfi-and-barashs-economics-as-an-evolutionary-science/ "Gandolfi, Gandolfi and Barash's Economics as an Evolutionary Science"):
        The title captures the book's core focus on translating the
        economic concept of utility into the biological concept of
        fitness.

5.  Oded Galor's [Unified Growth
        Theory](http://jasoncollins.blog/2013/09/04/galors-unified-growth-theory/ "Galor's Unified Growth Theory"):
        A fine summary of the most serious attempt to accommodate human
        evolution into theories of economic growth. Highly technical and
        not an easy read.

6.  Sheldon Garon’s [Beyond Our Means: Why America Spends While the
        World
        Saves](http://jasoncollins.blog/2012/01/04/garons-beyond-our-means/ "Garon's Beyond Our Means"):
        Plenty of interesting historical fodder on savings but feels
        incomplete.

7.  Gerd Gigerenzer's [Gut Feelings: Short Cuts to Better Decision
        Making](https://wordpress.com/post/jasoncollins.blog/22968):
        Perhaps the best balance between nuance and accessibility of
        Gigerenzer's popular books. While it still leaves an impression
        about the accuracy of our instincts that I'm not completely in
        agreement with, it provides a good overview of how our gut
        feelings can lead to good decisions.

8.  Gerd Gigerenzer's [Rationality for Mortals: How People Cope with
        Uncertainty](https://wordpress.com/post/jasoncollins.blog/23037):
        Great. Good coverage of ecological rationality, heuristics that
        make us smart, and understanding risk.

9.  Gerd Gigerenzer's [Risk
        Savvy](http://jasoncollins.blog/2014/09/10/nudging-citizens-to-be-risk-savvy/ "Nudging citizens to be risk savvy"):
        Gigerenzer's least satisfactory but still interesting book.

10. Gerd Gigerenzer, Peter Todd and the ABC Research Group's [Simple
        Heuristics That Make Us
        Smart](http://jasoncollins.blog/2017/03/13/simple-heuristics-that-make-us-smart/):
        Excellent. A nice contrast to the increasing use of complex
        machine learning algorithms for decision making, although it is
        that same increasing use that makes some parts of the book are
        seem a touch dated.

11. Malcolm Gladwell’s (2008) [Outliers: The Story of
        Success](http://jasoncollins.blog/2011/03/21/gladwells-outliers/ "Gladwell's Outliers"):
        Like all of Gladwell's book - flawed but supremely interesting.

12. Jonathan Gottschall's [The Storytelling Animal: How Stories Make
        Us
        Human](http://jasoncollins.blog/2016/04/01/gottschalls-the-storytelling-animal/) :
        Gottschall argues that storytelling is often deeply moral, normally deals with problems of great (evolutionary) relevance
        to us and is a major cohering force in society. I tend to agree.

1.  Jonathan Haidt's [The Righteous Mind: Why Good People Are
        Divided by Politics and
        Religion](http://jasoncollins.blog/2012/09/26/haidts-the-righteous-mind/ "Haidt's The Righteous Mind"):
        A brilliant analysis of why people are divided by politics and religion. Just don't buy his arguments on group selection.

1.  Dan Hamermesh's [Beauty Pays: Why Attractive People Are More
        Successful](http://jasoncollins.blog/2011/09/20/hamermeshs-beauty-pays/ "Hamermesh's Beauty Pays"):
        Beauty has its benefits, but are the beautiful more productive?

2.  Tim Harford's (2011) [Adapt: Why Success Always Starts with
        Failure](http://jasoncollins.blog/2012/02/17/harfords-adapt-why-success-always-starts-with-failure/ "Harford’s Adapt: Why Success Always Starts with Failure"):
        Harford applies evolutionary thinking to business, war, accidents and other human pursuits. Excellent.

1.  Joe Henrich’s [The Secret of Our Success: How Culture Is Driving
        Human Evolution, Domesticating Our Species, and Making Us
        Smarter](https://jasoncollins.blog/2016/11/14/henrichs-the-secret-of-our-success-how-culture-is-driving-human-evolution-domesticating-our-species-and-making-us-smarter/):
        A lot of interesting ideas, but left me with a lot of questions.

2.  Victor Hwang and Greg Horowitt’s [The Rainforest: The Secret to
        Building the Next Silicon
        Valley](http://jasoncollins.blog/2013/04/30/hwang-and-horowitts-the-rainforest/ "Hwang and Horowitt's The Rainforest"):
        Entrepreneurship though a biological lens.

3.  Greg Ip's [Foolproof: Why Safety Can Be Dangerous and How Danger
        Makes Us
        Safe](http://jasoncollins.blog/2017/09/28/ips-foolproof-why-safety-can-be-dangerous-and-how-danger-makes-us-safe/): Engineers
        seek to use the sum of our human knowledge to make us safer.
        Ecologists recognise that many of our solutions will have unintended consequences that can be worse than the problems we
        are trying to solve. Much of Ip’s book is a catalogue of the failures of engineering.

1.  Garett Jones’s [Hive Mind: How Your Nation’s IQ Matters So Much
        More Than Your Own](https://jasoncollins.blog/2016/11/04/joness-hive-mind-how-your-nations-iq-matters-so-much-more-than-your-own/):
        A fantastic exposition of some important but neglected features
        of the world.

1.  Daniel Kahneman's [Thinking, Fast and
        Slow](http://jasoncollins.blog/2012/01/18/kahnemans-thinking-fast-and-slow/ "Kahneman's Thinking, Fast and Slow"):
        While the field of behavioural economics has not yet made the
        step into evolutionary biology, this overview is the
        best. However, it is [not standing the test of time particularly
        well](http://jasoncollins.blog/2016/06/29/re-reading-kahnemans-thinking-fast-and-slow/).
    
2.  Garry Kasparov's [Deep Thinking: Where Machine Intelligence Ends
        and Human Creativity
        Begins](http://jasoncollins.blog/2017/07/19/kasparovs-deep-thinking-where-machine-intelligence-ends-and-human-creativity-begins/): More
        a history of man versus machine in chess than a deep analysis of
        human or machine intelligence.

3.  Eric Kaufmann’s [Shall the Religious Inherit the Earth?:
        Demography and Politics in the Twenty-First
        Century](http://jasoncollins.blog/2016/07/22/kaufmanns-shall-the-religious-inherit-the-earth-demography-and-politics-in-the-twenty-first-century/): Even
        if you assign a low probability to Kaufmann’s projections, it
        provides another strand to the case that low fertility in the
        secular West is not without costs.

4.  John Kay’s [Other People’s
        Money](http://jasoncollins.blog/2016/03/08/kays-other-peoples-money/): A
        generally excellent book arguing that the growth in the size of
        the financial system hasn’t been matched by improvements in the
        allocation of capital.

5.  Kevin Kelly's [What Technology
        Wants](http://jasoncollins.blog/2012/09/19/kellys-what-technology-wants/ "Kelly's What Technology Wants"):
        Ignoring his near-religious fervour, Kelly provides a strong
        argument that the growth in technology is primarily beneficial.

6.  Doug Kenrick and Vlad Griskevicius’s [The Rational Animal: How
        Evolution Made Us Smarter Than We
        Think](http://jasoncollins.blog/2016/02/08/kenrick-and-griskeviciuss-the-rational-animal/): A
        good introduction to the idea that evolutionary psychology could
        add a lot of value to behavioural economics, but has the
        occasional straw man discussion of economics and a heavy
        reliance on priming research.

7.  Jonathan Last’s [What to Expect When No One’s Expecting:
        America’s Coming Demographic
        Disaster](https://jasoncollins.blog/2016/07/18/lasts-what-to-expect-when-no-ones-expecting-americas-coming-demographic-disaster/):
        Much to disagree or argue with, but entertaining and a lot to
        like.

8.  David Levine’s [Is Behavioural Economics
        Doomed?](http://jasoncollins.blog/2016/06/23/levines-is-behavioural-economics-doomed/):
        A good but slightly frustrating read. Littered with straw man
        arguments.

9.  Michael Lewis’s [The Undoing Project: A Friendship That Changed
        The
        World](http://jasoncollins.blog/2018/02/21/michael-lewiss-the-undoing-project-a-friendship-that-changed-the-world/):
        A layperson would struggle to find a more accessible and
        interesting introduction to behavioural science and behavioural
        economics.

10. Benoit Mandelbrot and Richard Hudson’s [The (mis)Behaviour of
        Markets: A Fractal View of Risk, Ruin, and
        Reward](http://jasoncollins.blog/2016/10/12/mandelbrot-and-hudsons-the-misbehaviour-of-markets-a-fractal-view-of-risk-ruin-and-reward/):
        A clear critique of the underpinnings of modern financial
        theory.

11. Jim Manzi's [Uncontrolled: The Surprising Payoff of
        Trial-and-Error for Business, Politics, and
        Society](http://jasoncollins.blog/2015/01/28/manzis-uncontrolled/):
        Excellent. The high “causal density” in social science settings
        nearly always results in the possibility that there is an
        important factor you have missed or do not understand. No matter
        what our worldview, we should be prepared to allow
        experimentation with alternatives, as we may well be wrong.

12. Joanna Masel’s [Bypass Wall Street: A Biologist’s Guide to the
        Rat
        Race](http://jasoncollins.blog/2016/04/06/masels-bypass-wall-street-a-biologists-guide-to-the-rat-race/):
        Interesting, although would have benefited from more of a
        biological lens.

13. Michael Mauboussin’s [More Than You Know: Finding Financial
        Wisdom in Unconventional
        Places](http://jasoncollins.blog/2018/04/12/michael-mauboussins-more-than-you-know-finding-financial-wisdom-in-unconventional-places/):
        We need an interdisciplinary toolkit to give us the diversity to
        make good decisions.

14. Michael Mauboussin’s [Think Twice: Harnessing the Power of
        Counterintuition](http://jasoncollins.blog/2018/08/01/michael-mauboussins-think-twice-harnessing-the-power-of-counterintuition/):
        A multi-disciplinary book on how to improve your decision
        making. Not great depth, but interesting pointers to new ideas.

15. Geoffrey Miller's [Spent: Sex, Evolution, and Consumer
        Behavior](http://jasoncollins.blog/2011/06/15/millers-spent-sex-evolution-and-consumer-behavior/ "Miller's Spent: Sex, Evolution, and Consumer Behavior"):
        Evolution shaped our consumer preferences but they do not always
        work perfectly in a modern environment.

16. Ian Morris’s [Why the West Rules - for
        Now](http://jasoncollins.blog/2011/04/27/morriss-why-the-west-rules-for-now/ "Morris's Why the West Rules For Now"): History
        is made by lazy, greedy, frightened people (who rarely know what
        they’re doing) looking for easier, more profitable, and safer
        ways to do things.

17. Sendhil Mullainathan and Eldar Shafir’s [Scarcity: Why Having
        Too Little Means So
        Much](http://jasoncollins.blog/2014/09/18/scarcity-of-time-money-friends-and-bandwidth/ "Scarcity of time, money, friends and bandwidth"):
        A novel way of looking at scarcity that extends beyond the
        typical analysis in economics, but I’m not convinced I have been
        presented with a coherent new perspective on how the world
        works.

18. Richard Nelson and Sidney Winter's [An Evolutionary Theory of
        Economic
        Change](http://jasoncollins.blog/2013/11/11/nelson-and-winters-an-evolutionary-theory-of-economic-change/ "Nelson and Winter's An Evolutionary Theory of Economic Change"):
        The seminal book that established evolutionary economics as a
        serious field.

19. Cal Newport’s [So Good They Can’t Ignore You: Why Skills Trump
        Passion in the Quest for Work You
        Love](http://jasoncollins.blog/2016/11/30/newports-so-good-they-cant-ignore-you-why-skills-trump-passion-in-the-quest-for-work-you-love/):
        Basic (albeit good) economic advice dressed up in self-help
        style.

20. Cathy O'Neil's [Weapons of Math Destruction: How Big Data
        Increases Inequality and Threatens
        Democracy](http://jasoncollins.blog/2017/08/22/oneils-weapons-of-math-destruction-how-big-data-increases-inequality-and-threatens-democracy/):
        O'Neil makes a strong and persuasive case that many algorithms
        could be developed or used better. But it is often unclear what
        exactly the problem is or what potential solutions could
        (should) be.

21. Paul Ormerod's [Why Most Things
        Fail](http://jasoncollins.blog/2012/07/28/ormerods-why-most-things-fail/ "Ormerod's Why Most Things Fail"):
        Failure is all around us. But after building a great picture of
        the complexity of the world, the applications seem half-baked.

22. Charles Perrow’s [Normal Accidents: Living with High-Risk
        Technologies](http://jasoncollins.blog/2017/11/02/perrows-normal-accidents-living-with-high-risk-technologies/): We
        should stop trying to fix systems prone to normal accidents in
        ways that only make them riskier. We should focus instead on
        reducing the potential for catastrophe when there is failure.

23. Paul Rubin's [Darwinian Politics: The Evolutionary Origin of
        Freedom](http://jasoncollins.blog/2012/05/07/rubins-darwinian-politics/ "Rubin's Darwinian Politics"):
        Humans naturally seek political freedom and Modern Western
        societies do the best job of meeting these needs.

24. Phil Rosenzweig’s [Left Brain, Right Stuff: How Leaders Make
        Winning
        Decisions](http://jasoncollins.blog/2016/11/25/rosenzweigs-left-brain-right-stuff-how-leaders-make-winning-decisions/):
        An entertaining examination of how behavioural economics
        findings hold up for real world decision making.

25. Phil Rosenzweig’s [The Halo Effect … and the Eight Other
        Business Delusions That Deceive
        Managers](http://jasoncollins.blog/2016/09/21/rosenzweigs-the-halo-effect-and-the-eight-other-business-delusions-that-deceive-managers/): Largely
        an exercise of shooting fish in a barrel, but is an entertaining
        read regardless.

26. Gad Saad's [The Evolutionary Bases of
        Consumption](http://jasoncollins.blog/2012/04/05/saads-the-evolutionary-bases-of-consumption/ "Saad's The Evolutionary Bases of Consumption"):
        This book has more material taking on the Standard Social
        Science Model approach to consumption than is fun to wade
        through, but Saad's book is still the go to source for material
        on the evolutionary psychology approach to consumption.
    
27. Gilles Saint-Paul's [The Tyranny of Utility: Behavioral Social
        Science and the Rise of
        Paternalism](http://jasoncollins.blog/2016/05/26/saint-pauls-the-tyranny-of-utility-behavioral-social-science-and-the-rise-of-paternalism/):
        Sometimes hard to share Saint-Paul's anger, but some important
        underlying points.

28. Robert Sapolsky's [Why Zebra's Don't Get
        Ulcers](http://jasoncollins.blog/2018/07/25/robert-sapolskys-why-zebras-dont-get-ulcers/):
        A wonderful book on the psychology and physiology of stress.

29. Paul Seabright's [The War of the Sexes: How Conflict and
        Cooperation Have Shaped Men and Women from Prehistory to the
        Present](http://jasoncollins.blog/2012/05/22/seabrights-the-war-of-the-sexes/ "Seabright's The War of the Sexes"):
        A decent primer on sexual selection and some interesting
        applications, but does not always engage with the cutting edge
        of the debate.

30. Nate Silver’s [The Signal and the Noise: Why So Many Predictions
        Fail— but Some
        Don’t](http://jasoncollins.blog/2013/09/25/silvers-the-signal-and-the-noise/ "Silver's The Signal and the Noise"): Not
        a “how to” book, although there are plenty of principles (and
        suggestions to be humble) worth following.

31. Robert Sugden's  The Community of Advantage: A Behavioural
        Economist’s Defence of the Market: A well-balanced critique on
        how the behavioural research has been interpreted and used as
        part of the “nudge” movement to develop recommendations for the
        “planner”, “benevolent autocrat” or “choice architect”.

32. Cass Sunstein and Reid Hastie's [Wiser: Getting Beyond
        Groupthink to Make Groups
        Smarter](http://jasoncollins.blog/2018/03/28/cass-sunstein-and-reid-hasties-wiser-getting-beyond-groupthink-to-make-groups-smarter/):
        Not an exciting read, but a good catalogue of group
        decision-making research.

33. Philip Tetlock’s [Expert Political Judgment: How Good Is It? How
        Can We
        Know?](https://jasoncollins.blog/2016/08/25/tetlocks-expert-political-judgment-how-good-is-it-how-can-we-know/):
        One of the grander undertakings in social science..

34. Philip Tetlock and Dan Gardner’s [Superforecasting: The Art and
        Science of
        Prediction](http://jasoncollins.blog/2016/09/12/tetlock-and-gardners-superforecasting-the-art-and-science-of-prediction/):
        Doesn’t quite measure up to Tetlock’s superb [Expert Political
        Judgment](https://jasoncollins.blog/2016/08/25/tetlocks-expert-political-judgment-how-good-is-it-how-can-we-know/) (read
        EPJ first), but it contains more than enough interesting
        material to make it worth the read.

35. Richard Thaler and Cass
        Sunstein’s [Nudge](http://jasoncollins.blog/2013/11/04/thaler-and-sunsteins-nudge/ "Thaler and Sunstein's Nudge"): If
        you’re familiar with much of the behavioural science literature,
        the book covers a lot of stuff you already know. But there are a
        lot of bureaucrats and politicians who, among others, should
        read the whole book.

36. Peter Thiel’s [Zero to One: Notes on Startups, or How to Build
        the
        Future](http://jasoncollins.blog/2016/02/15/thiels-zero-to-one/):
        Many interesting and contrary arguments, but this is not a book
        where they are buttressed with evidence to convince you they are
        true.

37. Robert Trivers's [The Folly of Fools: The Logic of Deceit and
        Self-Deception in Human
        Life](http://jasoncollins.blog/2012/02/03/triverss-the-folly-of-fools/ "Trivers's The Folly of Fools"):
        Some gems surrounded by political rants.

38. Thorstein Veblen‘s [The Theory of the Leisure
        Class](http://jasoncollins.blog/2018/04/25/thorstein-veblens-the-theory-of-the-leisure-class/ "Veblen's The Theory of the Leisure Class"):
        The classic on status and conspicuous consumption.

39. Chris Voss’s (with Tahl Raz) [Never Split the Difference:
        Negotiating as if your life depended on
        it](http://jasoncollins.blog/2018/10/25/chris-vosss-never-split-the-difference-negotiating-as-if-your-life-depended-on-it/): Interesting
        ideas on how to approach negotiation, but I don’t know how much
        weight to give them. How much expertise could be developed in
        hostage negotiations? Can that expertise be distilled into
        principles, or is much of it tacit knowledge?

40. E.O. Wilson's [The Social Conquest of
        Earth](http://jasoncollins.blog/2014/11/17/e-o-wilsons-the-social-conquest-of-earth/ "E.O. Wilson’s The Social Conquest of Earth"):
        A confusing take on kin and group selection.

41. Philip Zimbardo’s [The Lucifer Effect: Understanding How Good
        People Turn
        Evil](http://jasoncollins.blog/2011/12/19/zimbardos-the-lucifer-effect/ "Zimbardo's The Lucifer Effect"): The
        situation is more important than a person’s disposition.
