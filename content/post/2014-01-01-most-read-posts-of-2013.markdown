As has been the case since I started blogging, I have almost no ability to predict in advance which posts will be popular or not. Here are the most read posts in 2013:



	
  1. [Six signs you're reading good criticism of economics](https://jasoncollins.blog/six-signs-youre-reading-good-criticism-of-economics/) - It's slightly depressing that this post, whipped up in half an hour in an airport, was most read for the year. It received over 10,000 views, when other posts that I spend days thinking about are lucky to rack up 1,000.

	
  2. [O-ring and foolproof sectors](https://jasoncollins.blog/o-ring-and-foolproof-sectors/) - Some quick thoughts on Garett Jones's paper in the Journal of Economic Behavior and Organization. Most traffic for this one came through search.

	
  3. [Fertility is going to go up](https://jasoncollins.blog/fertility-is-going-to-go-up/) - The good side of blogging - broadcasting my ideas to a wide audience.

	
  4. [Economics and evolutionary biology reading list](https://jasoncollins.blog/economics-and-evolutionary-biology-reading-list/) - The list has received constant traffic for a couple of years now. I keep it updated (and will review again in the next month or so).

	
  5. [The Out-of-Africa Hypothesis: Human genetic diversity and comparative economic development](https://jasoncollins.blog/the-out-of-africa-hypothesis-human-genetic-diversity-and-comparative-economic-development/) - My opening post on Ashraf andf Galor's paper linking genetic diversity and economic development. The series of posts I wrote on their paper all received strong traffic (and they're linked to at the bottom of the first post).

	
  6. [Paleo-hypotheses](https://jasoncollins.blog/paleo-hypotheses/) - Posting on 'paleo' is guaranteed traffic, no matter the quality of the post or the thought I have put into it.

	
  7. [Kremer's O-ring theory of economic development](https://jasoncollins.blog/kremers-o-ring-theory-of-economic-development/) - Most traffic for this post was from click-throughs from number 2 on this list and through search.

	
  8. [The benefits of Chinese eugenics](https://jasoncollins.blog/the-benefits-of-chinese-eugenics/)

	
  9. [The IQ barrier](https://jasoncollins.blog/the-iq-barrier/)

	
  10. [Genetics and the increase in obesity](https://jasoncollins.blog/genetics-and-the-increase-in-obesity/)
