title: Best books I read in 2015

A touch late, but as for earlier years, my list comprises the best books I read in the year, not the best of those released in the year (in fact, almost every book I read was released before 2015). It's a short list - I read only 20 or so non-fiction book this year - but here it is:

[Triumph of the City: How Our Greatest Invention Makes Us Richer, Smarter, Greener, Healthier, and Happier](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00DELNNY2/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=B00DELNNY2&linkCode=as2&tag=evolvieconom-20&linkId=2ITE4QISQ53OMZ46) by Edward Glaeser. A strong message for environmentalists.

[Spent](https://jasoncollins.blog/2011/06/15/millers-spent-sex-evolution-and-consumer-behavior/) by Geoffrey Miller. I included this book in my [2011 list](https://jasoncollins.blog/2011/12/27/best-books-i-read-in-2011/), but read it again this year in preparation for a presentation I was giving. It deserves to be listed again. Evolutionary psychology at its most readable.

[Uncontrolled:The Surprising Payoff of Trial-and-Error for Business, Politics, and Society](https://jasoncollins.blog/2015/01/28/manzis-uncontrolled/) by James Manzi. It should be read by every social scientist.

I read a bunch of long classics, including Tolstoy's War and Peace and Anna Karenina, and Conrad's Nostromo (fantastic). One strong recommendation is Richard Flanagan’s [The Narrow Road to the Deep North](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0804171475/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=0804171475&linkCode=as2&tag=evolvieconom-20&linkId=G5DRVIFFNG5MDJG6).

As an aside, I also re-read Daniel Kahneman's[ Thinking, Fast and Slow](https://jasoncollins.blog/2012/01/18/kahnemans-thinking-fast-and-slow/). I included it in my [2012 list](https://jasoncollins.blog/2012/12/28/the-best-books-i-read-in-2012/), and my rating of it has dropped. The last four years haven't been kind to some sections. (I posted about this [here](https://jasoncollins.blog/2016/06/29/re-reading-kahnemans-thinking-fast-and-slow/)).

I’ve got a dozen or so sets of notes from books I read last year that I hope to turn into posts in the near future - including for [The Triumph of the City](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00DELNNY2/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=B00DELNNY2&linkCode=as2&tag=evolvieconom-20&linkId=2ITE4QISQ53OMZ46), Kenrick and Griskevicius's [The Rational Animal](https://jasoncollins.blog/2016/02/08/kenrick-and-griskeviciuss-the-rational-animal/), Saad's[ The Consuming Instinct](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1616144297/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=1616144297&linkCode=as2&tag=evolvieconom-20&linkId=AY5RKH7GLPWVLWHD), Thiel's[ Zero to One](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0804139296/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=0804139296&linkCode=as2&tag=evolvieconom-20&linkId=YIV4VKC6ZFMW6NOW), Levitin's[ The Organized Mind](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0147516315/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=0147516315&linkCode=as2&tag=evolvieconom-20&linkId=XM5PQN7Y3DMTTJDA) and Taleb's[ Antifragile](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0812979680/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=0812979680&linkCode=as2&tag=evolvieconom-20&linkId=7FSD4VUAL2KB3T57).

And although I've got copies, I haven't yet read Garett Jones's [Hive Mind](https://jasoncollins.blog/2016/11/04/joness-hive-mind-how-your-nations-iq-matters-so-much-more-than-your-own/), Joe Henrich's [The Secret of Our Success](https://jasoncollins.blog/2016/11/14/henrichs-the-secret-of-our-success-how-culture-is-driving-human-evolution-domesticating-our-species-and-making-us-smarter/) or Greg Ip's [Foolproof](https://jasoncollins.blog/2017/09/28/ips-foolproof-why-safety-can-be-dangerous-and-how-danger-makes-us-safe/) (although I have been giving out the first two of these as Christmas presents).
