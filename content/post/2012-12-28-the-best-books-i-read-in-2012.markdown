As is normally the case, my annual list comprises the best books _I have read_ in the past year, irrespective of their date of release. I read fewer books this year than usual, so I'm drawing from a smaller pool than for the last couple of years ([2010](https://jasoncollins.blog/2010/12/top-10-books-in-2010/) and [2011](https://jasoncollins.blog/2011/12/best-books-i-read-in-2011/)). Here are my favourite six for 2012:

[Passions Within Reason: The Strategic Role of the Emotions](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0393960226/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=evolvieconom-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=0393960226) by Robert Frank ([my review](https://jasoncollins.blog/2012/06/franks-passions-within-reason/)): A book I should have read a long time ago. I particularly appreciated Frank's use of path-dependent evolution to develop his model of human behaviour.

[The Righteous Mind: Why Good People Are Divided by Politics and Religion](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0307455777/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=evolvieconom-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=0307455777) by Jonathan Haidt ([my review](https://jasoncollins.blog/2012/09/haidts-the-righteous-mind/)): At the top of many lists for good reason.

[Adapt: Why Success Always Starts with Failure](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1250007550/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=evolvieconom-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=1250007550) by Tim Harford ([my review](https://jasoncollins.blog/2012/02/harfords-adapt-why-success-always-starts-with-failure/)): Apart from being interesting and full of reasonable advice, Harford demonstrates a deep understanding of evolutionary processes, which is not often the case in books of this nature.

[Thinking, Fast and Slow](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0374533555/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=evolvieconom-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=0374533555) by Daniel Kahneman ([my review](https://jasoncollins.blog/2012/01/kahnemans-thinking-fast-and-slow/)): Magnificent. The clear and accessible way that each chapter illustrates a bias or heuristic makes it the best book on rationality and decision-making that I have read.

[Moby Dick](http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/2701) by Herman Melville: The best classic I read this year. Although I could have skipped some of the detours, many are fascinating.

[Darwinian Politics: The Evolutionary Origin of Freedom](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0813530962/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=evolvieconom-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=0813530962) by Paul Rubin ([my review](https://jasoncollins.blog/2012/05/rubins-darwinian-politics/)): A strong argument for political institutions that maximise freedom.

There are a few books that I read this year that have me in two minds, so I haven't included them in the above list. I enjoyed Ridley's [The Rational Optimist: How Prosperity Evolves](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0061452068/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=evolvieconom-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=0061452068)  ([my review](https://jasoncollins.blog/2012/04/ridleys-the-rational-optimist/)), but despite his claims to the contrary, Ridley stretched the evolutionary metaphor too far in drawing a Panglossian case. Robert Trivers's [The Folly of Fools: The Logic of Deceit and Self-Deception in Human Life](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0465027555/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=evolvieconom-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=0465027555) ([my review](https://jasoncollins.blog/2012/02/triverss-the-folly-of-fools/)) would have required a much more thorough editing to make this list. I also enjoyed Kevin Kelly's [What Technology Wants](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0085S0IC4/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=evolvieconom-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=B0085S0IC4) ([my review](https://jasoncollins.blog/2012/09/kellys-what-technology-wants/)), despite not buying the central argument.

Of the books I have in my reading pile, I still haven't got to Pinker's [The Better Angels of Our Nature: Why Violence Has Declined](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0143122010/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=evolvieconom-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=0143122010), and I intend to read Flynn's [Are We Getting Smarter?: Rising IQ in the Twenty-First Century](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1107609178/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=evolvieconom-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=1107609178) over the Christmas break (edit: review [here](https://jasoncollins.blog/2013/02/25/flynns-are-we-getting-smarter/)). Hopefully they will crack next year's list.
