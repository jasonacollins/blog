Links this week:






	
  1. [Behavioral Public Choice: The Behavioral Paradox of Government Policy](http://mercatus.org/sites/default/files/Viscusi-Behavioral-Public-Choice.pdf). HT: [Ryan Murphy](https://twitter.com/increasingmu)

	
  2. [Happiness and growth](http://stumblingandmumbling.typepad.com/stumbling_and_mumbling/2015/04/happiness-policy-growth.html).

	
  3. [The genetic component of sex offending](http://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/crime/men-up-to-five-times-more-likely-to-commit-sex-crimes-than-the-average-male-if-they-have-brother-or-father-convicted-of-a-sex-offence-10163025.html).

	
  4. ["[I]is growth mindset the one concept in psychology which throws up gigantic effect sizes and always works? Or did Carol Dweck really, honest-to-goodness, make a pact with the Devil in which she offered her eternal soul in exchange for spectacular study results?"](http://slatestarcodex.com/2015/04/08/no-clarity-around-growth-mindset-yet/)

	
  5. A new Charles Murray book - [By the People: Rebuilding Liberty Without Permission](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0385346514/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=0385346514&linkCode=as2&tag=evolvieconom-20&linkId=YDFUJK7S5OR7WT5O)

	
  6. [Evolution continues](http://www.unz.com/gnxp/the-dutch-are-tall-because-evolution-in-part/).

	
  7. [The weird belief that people follow dietary guidelines](http://velvetgloveironfist.blogspot.com.au/2015/04/the-weird-belief-that-people-follow.html). A question - to what extent do food manufacturers respond to the guidelines, especially to earn "heart smart" certifications and the like?

	
  8. [Economics melts the brain](http://econlog.econlib.org/archives/2015/04/how_econ_melts.html). One alternative which I've often seen is, because the model assumptions simply don't work, they throw every bit of economics they've ever learnt out the window and revert to storytelling.




And if you missed it, my one post this week:






	
  1. [Predicting replication](https://jasoncollins.blog/2015/04/10/predicting-replication/).


And a blast from the past: [Why isn't economics evolutionary?](https://jasoncollins.blog/2013/11/13/why-isnt-economics-evolutionary/)
