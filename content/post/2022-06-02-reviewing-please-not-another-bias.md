In 2015 I presented at the Marketing and Science Ideas Exchange (MSIX)[ADD LINK] conference. I posted my presentation, "Please Not Another Bias! An Evolutionary Take on Behavioural Economics", on this blog. It ended up with around 100,000 readers (a lot for this blog) and a [copy of the post on Evonomics](ADD%20LINK) was the most popular post in the first year of that site.

I still see the post occasionally shared, which brings a slight cringe, as its not the article I would have written today. I stand by the general argument, but there are several points that I would like to change.

First, I wrote it for a marketing audience. It would be nice if it were more general.

Second, I believe the case for better theory - in place of lists of biases - has only grown, so I would like to make that case. A lack of theory is one factor behind the replication crisis.

Third, while I still believe evolutionary biology should be part of the development of better theories of human decision making (to move away from the collection of biases) - and any theory must be consistent with evolutionary theory - I now consider that there could be a more eclectic selection of disciplines that could contribute.

Fourth, and the reason for this post, is that most of the science I quoted should be considered shaky at best. XX The Open Science Collaboration's first article was still XXXX years away, and the story of John Bargh and the filed replication of his priming experiment were still some way off. In that sense, I was somewhat naive.

For the remainder of this post I plan to walk through some of my claims and the science to support them. Which would I trust today?

I opened with a fairly broad claim that I will stand by.

> So, let's do a quick quiz. Tell me two things about the driver of this Ferrari (I have stolen this example from University of New South Wales evolutionary biologist [Rob Brooks](http://www.robbrooks.net/)).
>
> First, the driver was male.
>
> Second, the driver is likely young (in this case, 25).

I"ll back this being a robust phenomena, although I'll back the point on sex more strongly than that for age.

This next part is storytelling, but I don't believe it is wrong.

> So why is this the case?
>
> Females -- and in biology, this is in part how females are defined -- produce a large immobile egg. Males produce a smaller gamete -- sperm. The egg is the scarce resource. Women are born with a million or so eggs, but they release only one or so a month. Men produce 1,500 sperm a second. Each man in this room will produce enough sperm during this talk to fertilise every egg the women in this room will ever produce.
>
> Then there is what happens when a sperm and an egg are joined. The woman spends nine months carrying the baby -- and is unable to reproduce during that time. She then provides the majority of infant care. Men are less constrained by any such barriers.
>
> Then throw in that women are certain of maternity, whereas men may not be certain of paternity, and you have vastly different patterns of reproduction between the sexes.
>
> More men than women have zero children - the worst possible evolutionary outcome. A man who applies no standards to a mate choice may still go without. A woman would never have that problem.
>
> Then, for a few men, the rewards are vast.
>
> As one example, [approximately 16 million men in central Asia carry the same Y chromosome](https://doi.org/10.1086/367774) -- the Y chromosome is passed from down the male lineage from father to son. This chromosome originated in Mongolia around 1000 AD with around 8 per cent of the men in the region carrying it (0.5% of the world's male population) -- they all trace their male lineage back to the same man.
>
> One possibility is that this chromosome was so successful as it was carried by Genghis Khan and his close relatives. Genghis had multiple wives and a harem. He may have fathered thousands of children. His grandson Kublai Khan was famous for the size of his harem -- I have seen some estimates that it contained 7,000 women (although haven't been able to reliably source those estimates). Whether that number is accurate or not, it is feasible that Kublai Khan could have been having hundreds of children a year.
>
> No woman could ever have that level of success -- but for men, the evolutionary rewards to success can be vast.
>
> This brings us back to our Ferrari driver. As a male, the risk-reward calculation in evolutionary terms is quite different from women. Men face a higher probability of evolutionary oblivion, and small chance of an evolutionary extravaganza. It makes sense to take risks that may lead to inordinate evolutionary success -- or at least to avoid evolutionary oblivion.

The problem comes when I try to add some "science(TM)" to my case.

> One of my favourite examples of this comes from [research by Richard Ronay and Bill von Hippel](https://doi.org/10.1177/1948550609352807). They got some young male skateboarders to perform tricks, including a difficult trick that they could complete only half the time. Halfway through filming, a woman rated as highly attractive (corroborated by "many informal comments and phone number requests from the skateboarders") walked onto the scene. Once she appeared, they took more risks and were less likely to bail a trick half-way through, instead riding all the way through to the crash landing ([a story on ABC's Catalyst demonstrates this effect](http://www.abc.net.au/catalyst/stories/2967720.htm)).
>
> First, this risk taking should be seen in the context of what they are trying to achieve -- attracting the female. So much of economics -- and behavioural economics -- is looking at the wrong objective.
>
> Second, this change in risk preference in the presence of a woman points to one of the most important findings in evolutionary psychology -- our decision-making changes with the immediate context. We might be considered to be different personalities. Evolution has not shaped an all-knowing computer, but rather a modular computer for making different decisions based on different contexts.

In this experiment we have X skateboarders performing XX tricks. Each trick is treated as a single observation - although I think some kind of multi-level model would be appropriate here.

That one of the authors is Bill von Hippel is also interesting. Replication index. At the bottom. Went about investigating. XXX

The next study I referred to I trust even less.

> As an example of this, [show one group of people](https://doi.org/10.1509/jmkr.46.3.384) the movie The Shining, the other half a romantic movie starring Ethan Hawke. Then manipulate the ads they see during the movies to either accentuate the uniqueness of the product, or its popularity.
>
> Those watching The Shining are more likely to prefer popular products -- safety in numbers as their danger avoidance personality is triggered. For those watching the romantic movie, they wanted unique products so that they would stand out from the crowd. Their mating motives have been triggered. You effectively get a change in preferences based on which movie they are watching and which self is answering the questions about the products. The effectiveness of social proof varied with context.

Another study where I think the idea is likely right but the experimental setup shouldn't find it.

> In [an experiment by Margo Wilson and Martin Daly](https://doi.org/10.1098/rsbl.2003.0134) -- two of the pioneers of evolutionary psychology, and I recommend you read their book Homicide if you haven't -- they exposed men and women to either pictures of attractive faces or pictures of cars before undergoing tests of their degree of present bias.
>
> The men who had seen the attractive faces became more severe discounters than those who had seen the cars. They became focused on the present -- the mating opportunity.  The women did not become increasingly severe discounters in this experiment -- although there may be a smaller effect that the experiment did not have the power to detect.
>
> So here, what might be called a very strong present bias has a degree of rationality to it in that the objective of the participants is mating. Obviously, they didn't have a chance to mate with these pictures -- so there we have the issue of mismatch -- but you can see the evolutionary foundation of their decision. If they did manage to capitalise on that moment and manage to mate, their evolutionary future is set.

> [Take a group of men](https://doi.org/10.1037/0022-3514.93.1.85) and show them pictures of attractive women and then ask them what they will do with their money. The mating prime makes men more likely to engage in conspicuous consumption or conspicuous charitable donation, but has no effect on inconspicuous consumption.
>
> Women can also be affected by mating primes, although in that particular experiment their change in behaviour in response to pictures of attractive men was an desired increase in volunteering in a public way (but no increase in private benevolence).
>
> The difference reflects the different traits each are communicating -- men are communicating resources and the traits required to accumulate them, women their conscientiousness.

> On the effect of the signal, in [one study](https://doi.org/10.1348/000712609X417319) men and women were shown pictures of members of the opposite sex in either a red Ford Fiesta or a silver Bentley. Unfortunately the photos in the paper are provided in black and white -- as shown in this slide -- but these indicate the types of images the experimental subjects were shown.
>
> The result -- the expensive car made the male more attractive to the females, whereas there was no effect on male perception of the female drivers. The increase in male's attractiveness was equivalent to around 1 point on a scale of 1 to 10.

That I can't trust any of these studies is kinda annoying, as it leaves any evolutionary arguments being largely conceptual rather than

The evolutionary literature has had to effectively rely on the priming literature for many of its results.
