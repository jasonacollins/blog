title: Genetic diversity and economic development

Quamrul Ashraf and Oded Galor's paper linking genetic diversity and economic development has been available as a working paper for a few years, but it has now found a home in the American Economic Review (the latest available version of the working paper that I am aware of is available [here](http://ideas.repec.org/p/iza/izadps/dp6330.html)).

Science has picked up on the forthcoming publication is its [editor's choice section](http://www.sciencemag.org/content/337/6099/twil.full) (unfortunately gated without subscription). Science summarises the results as follows:

<blockquote>Ashraf and Galor present the hypothesis that genetic diversity has exerted a long-lasting effect on economic development — which is quantified as population density in the precolonial era and as per-capita income for contemporary nations — beyond the influences of geography, institutions, and culture. They posit that intermediate levels of heterozygosity allow for a productive balance between the social costs of high diversity and the creative benefits of higher variance in cognitive skills. They show that the optimal level of diversity was approximately 0.68 in 1500 CE, and that this increased to 0.72 (which is pretty much where the United States sits) in the year 2000, with the most homogeneous country, Bolivia, placed at 0.63 and the most diverse country, Ethiopia, at 0.77.</blockquote>

I recommend reading the comments on Marginal Revolution where [Tyler Cowen has noted the Science piece](http://marginalrevolution.com/marginalrevolution/2012/09/the-new-oded-galor-and-quamrul-ashraf-paper.html).
