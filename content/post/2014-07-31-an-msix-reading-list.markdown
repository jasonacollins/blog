Yesterday was day one of the [Marketing Science Ideas Xchange](http://msix.com.au/) (MSiX). As I mentioned in [a previous post](https://jasoncollins.blog/2014/07/11/msix-marketing-science-ideas-xchange/), it has been an interesting opportunity to see behavioural science outside of the academic and economics environments I am used to. There were a lot of interesting presentations, and a lot of good books were mentioned along the way.

First, a couple of blasts from the past: Claude Hopkins's [Scientific Advertising](https://amzn.to/2QoangY) (if the one dollar Amazon price is prohibitive, it doesn't take much searching to find some free pdf versions) and Vance Packard's [The Hidden Persuaders](https://amzn.to/2M7JCPn). The idea of injecting more science into advertising is not new.

The usual behavioural science texts got plenty of mentions, particularly Daniel Kahneman’s [Thinking, Fast and Slow](https://jasoncollins.blog/2016/06/29/re-reading-kahnemans-thinking-fast-and-slow/). System 1 and System 2 thinking were regular frames for the speakers (and in today's workshops). Richard Thaler and Cass Sunstein’s [Nudge](https://jasoncollins.blog/2013/11/04/thaler-and-sunsteins-nudge/) and Dan Ariely’s [Predictably Irrational](https://jasoncollins.blog/2013/09/02/arielys-predictably-irrational/) also got the expected mentions.

The first three speakers had an evolutionary thread in parts of their talks (nice to see), so naturally a few books I have plugged before came up. Rory Sutherland put up his [reading list from Verge](http://verge.ogilvydo.com/rory-sutherlands-reading-list), which includes Paul Seabright’s [The Company of Strangers](https://amzn.to/2YM5Dod), Jonathan Haidt’s [The Righteous Mind](https://jasoncollins.blog/2012/09/26/haidts-the-righteous-mind/), Robert Kurzban’s [Why Everyone (Else) Is a Hypocrite: Evolution and the Modular Mind](https://amzn.to/2VNQiS9) and Robert Frank’s [The Darwin Economy](https://jasoncollins.blog/2011/10/07/franks-the-darwin-economy/). All highly recommended, as is the rest of Sutherland's reading pile, although I haven’t read Stuart Sutherland’s [Irrationality: the enemy within](https://amzn.to/2WsIo57), which I suppose will get added to my list.

Another book I had not come across before was Iain McGilchrist’s [The Master and His Emissary: The Divided Brain and the Making of the Western World](https://amzn.to/2W4MXU1), which looks interesting.

Uri Gneezy and John List got a solid mention from the last presenter, Liam Smith from Monash University's [BehaviourWorks Australia](http://www.behaviourworksaustralia.org/). Gneezy and List's new book [The Why Axis: Hidden Motives and the Undiscovered Economics of Everyday Life](https://amzn.to/2Wao35v) is also sitting on my reading pile.

Outside of the presentations, a few other interesting books came up in conversation. They included Jim Manzi’s [Uncontrolled: The Surprising Payoff of Trial-and-Error for Business, Politics, and Society](https://jasoncollins.blog/2015/01/28/manzis-uncontrolled/), which should be on your reading list. One of my favourite books, Christopher Buckley’s [Thank You for Smoking](https://amzn.to/2Wo7q5j) was also mentioned, which was unsurprising considering the potential sin industry clients of many of the conference attendees – and if you do read it, rip out the last couple of pages. While Barry Schwartz's book [The Paradox of Choice](https://jasoncollins.blog/2019/02/25/barry-schwartzs-the-paradox-of-choice-why-more-is-less/) was not specifically mentioned, the phrase was regularly used.

Finally, Adam Ferrier, the conference curator, has a book out - [The Advertising Effect: How to Change Behaviour](https://jasoncollins.blog/2016/04/13/notes-on-a-few-books/). After organising a conference myself earlier in the year, I feel for him - many rewards but so much effort.
