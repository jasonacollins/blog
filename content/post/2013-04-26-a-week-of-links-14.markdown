Links this week:



	
  1. Hodgson and Knudsen have [set up a reading group](http://darwinsconjecture.wordpress.com/about/) for their book [Darwin's Conjecture: The Search for General Principles of Social and Economic Evolution](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004L62GUG/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=B004L62GUG&linkCode=as2&tag=evolvieconom-20). Chapter one has already kicked off.

	
  2. Another from The Umlaut - [Conspicuous Frugality](http://theumlaut.com/2013/04/24/conspicuous-frugality/).

	
  3. [Flip-flopping selection pressure](http://www.the-scientist.com/?articles.view/articleNo/35317/title/Humans-Under-Pressure/) in a modern population.

	
  4. Following from my post on Douglas Kenrick and colleagues' theory of [Deep Rationality](https://jasoncollins.blog/2013/04/deep-rationality-the-evolutionary-economics-of-decision-making/), below are a couple of short videos - one on How Mating and Self-Protection Motives Alter Loss Aversion, and the other on the upcoming book [The Rational Animal: How Evolution Made Us Smarter Than We Think](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0465032427/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=0465032427&linkCode=as2&tag=evolvieconom-20) by Kenrick and Vlad Griskevicius, which also looks like it covers similar territory.
