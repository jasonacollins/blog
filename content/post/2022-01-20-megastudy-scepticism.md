With much fanfare, in December a new "megastudy" was announced, a test of 54 different interventions to encourage exercise. But more that just testing these interventions, the authors (a very long list) stated 

>The lack of comparability of such individual investigations limits their potential to inform policy. Here, to address this limitation and accelerate the pace of discovery, we introduce the megastudy — a massive field experiment in which the effects of many different interventions are compared in the same population on the same objectively measured outcome for the same duration. I
I suppose the introduction is for those who missed May's paper by most of the same authors, [A megastudy of text-based nudges encouraging patients to get vaccinated at an upcoming doctor’s appointment](https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.2101165118). (To be fair, the exercise megastudy was submitted to a journal first.)

I do wonder what the threshold is for a megastudy. Does the Behavioural Insights team [trial of 8 different messages on organ donation](https://www.bi.team/publications/applying-behavioural-insights-to-organ-donation/) make the cut?
