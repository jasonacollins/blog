[Mike Walsh](http://www.mike-walsh.com) recently interviewed me for his [Between Worlds Podcast](http://www.mike-walsh.com/podcast), and here is the result. I largely talk about the material in two of my Behavioral Scientist articles on algorithm aversion ([1](http://behavioralscientist.org/dont-touch-computer/) and [2](http://behavioralscientist.org/what-to-do-when-algorithms-rule/)).

I listened to some of the Between Worlds back catalogue, and I recommend the following with David Epstein, author of [The Sports Gene](http://thesportsgene.com/).
