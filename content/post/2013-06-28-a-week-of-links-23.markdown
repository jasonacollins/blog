Links this week:



	
  1. If you read one thing this week, read this article by Enrico Spolaore and Romain Wacziarg: [How Deep Are the Roots of Economic Development?](http://www.aeaweb.org/articles.php?doi=10.1257/jel.51.2.325) (ungated version [here](http://sites.tufts.edu/enricospolaore/files/2012/08/RootsF.pdf)). I'll post in more detail on the article in a couple of weeks.

	
  2. [Henry Harpending on health after the Neolithic revolution](http://westhunt.wordpress.com/2013/06/26/bad-health-at-the-origins-of-agriculture/).

	
  3. [Noah Smith provides a list](http://noahpinionblog.blogspot.com.au/2013/06/some-essential-papers-in-behavioral.html) of essential papers in behavioural finance.
