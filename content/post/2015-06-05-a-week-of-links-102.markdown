Links this week:






	
  1. Two perspectives on the chocolate study - [Scott Alexander](http://slatestarcodex.com/2015/05/30/that-chocolate-study/) and [Andrew Gelman](http://andrewgelman.com/2015/05/29/i-fooled-millions-into-thinking-chocolate-helps-weight-loss-heres-how/). I would say that the chocolate study didn't tell us anything that we didn't already know.
