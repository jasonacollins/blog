The 2015 Marketing Science Ideas Xchange - MSiX - [has been announced](http://mumbrella.com.au/harvard-business-schools-michael-norton-to-headline-mumbrellas-marketing-science-conference-msix-299347) for 30 July in Sydney. As it says [in the blurb](http://www.msix.com.au/), MSiX "is dedicated to exploring how brands can benefit from the interface between behavioural science and marketing."

The headline speaker is [Michael Norton](http://www.hbs.edu/faculty/Pages/profile.aspx?facId=326229), Harvard professor, author of [Happy Money: The Science of Happier Spending](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1451665075/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=1451665075&linkCode=as2&tag=evolvieconom-20&linkId=XGBYO6MD4C6YK3HQ) and developer of the first set of experiments on the [IKEA effect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IKEA_effect) (that last point is the reason I knew his name when I heard he would be speaking).

The rest of the speakers and further detail on the conference are [here](http://www.msix.com.au/speakers/) - with the speaking line-up including me. I'll be talking about how behavioural economics (science) could benefit from a good dose of evolutionary biology, and how that evolutionary lens can be valuable in understanding consumer behaviour.

Last year's event - headlined by Rory Sutherland (who linked me into this MSiX world) - was a pretty good day, and this year looks promising too.

And here's Norton doing the TED thing.
