Links this week:






	
  1. [A conversation with Rory Sutherland](http://edge.org/conversation/this-thing-for-which-we-have-no-name). Many good pieces, but my favourite line:




<blockquote>Certainly there's a problem with numbers in that there are sophisticated things in life that we all understand perfectly well when verbally described. Should psychology be constrained by math? I mean, who has the better understanding of human behaviorâ€”Shakespeare or Eugene Fama? If you make mathematical expression a barrier to entry, to any kind of theory, you are undoubtedly limiting yourselves.</blockquote>





	
  2. [Another article taking a shot at the idea that "all calories are equal"](http://www.nytimes.com/2014/05/18/opinion/sunday/always-hungry-heres-why.html?smid=tw-nytimes&_r=0).
