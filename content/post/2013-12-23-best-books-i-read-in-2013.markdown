As is my habit, each year I give a list of the best books I have read during the year. I tend not to focus on the newest releases, so most of the list was not published this year. In no particular order:



	
  1. Paul Frijters and Gigi Foster's [An Economic Theory of Greed, Love, Groups, and Networks](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00BM4TI1K/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=B00BM4TI1K&linkCode=as2&tag=evolvieconom-20) (my reviews [here](https://jasoncollins.blog/an-economic-theory-of-greed-love-groups-and-networks/) and [here](https://jasoncollins.blog/the-love-principle/)): I don't buy into many of the arguments, but the most interesting book I read all year.

	
  2. Richard Nelson and Sidney Winter's [An Evolutionary Theory of Economic Change](https://jasoncollins.blog/2013/11/11/nelson-and-winters-an-evolutionary-theory-of-economic-change/): The book that kickstarted evolutionary economics as a serious pursuit. Although slightly dated, a great example of how to critique mainstream economics.

	
  3. Steven Pinker’s [The Better Angels of Our Nature: Why Violence Has Declined](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0143122010/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=evolvieconom-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=0143122010) (no review yet): Pinker's case is compelling and important.

	
  4. Oded Galor's [Unified Growth Theory](https://jasoncollins.blog/2013/09/04/galors-unified-growth-theory/): Another book for which I'm not completely onboard with the central arguments, but I love the ambition and ideas.

	
  5. I read a lot of classics this year. I thought Victor Hugo's Les Miserables was great. I loved the use of language in Vladimir Nabakov's Lolita. But ultimately, I enjoyed Jules Verne's [Twenty Thousand Leagues Under the Sea](http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/2488) the most (an early seasteader?).


Books I read that didn't make the list but are worth a mention include Nate Silver's [The Signal and the Noise: Why So Many Predictions Fail but Some Don’t](https://jasoncollins.blog/2013/09/25/silvers-the-signal-and-the-noise/) (I thought a couple of chapters were great, but just wasn't that excited by a lot of it) and Victor Hwang and Greg Horowitt’s [The Rainforest: The Secret to Building the Next Silicon Valley](https://jasoncollins.blog/2013/04/30/hwang-and-horowitts-the-rainforest/).
