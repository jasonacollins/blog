Here are three I recently enjoyed:



	
  1. Econtalk:[ Brian Nosek on the Reproducibility Project](http://www.econtalk.org/archives/2015/11/brian_nosek_on.html) - Contains a lot of interesting context about the reproducibility crisis (of which you can get a flavour from my presentation [Bad Behavioural Science: Failures, bias and fairy tales](https://jasoncollins.blog/2016/05/11/bad-behavioural-science-failures-bias-and-fairy-tales/)).

	
  2. Econtalk: [Phil Rosenzweig on Leadership, Decisions, and Behavioral Economics](http://www.econtalk.org/archives/2015/04/phil_rosenzweig.html) - The problems with taking behavioural economics findings out of the lab and applying them to business decision making.

	
  3. Radiolab: [The Rhino Hunter](http://www.radiolab.org/story/rhino-hunter/) - I listen to Radiolab less than when it had more of a science focus, but this podcast on hunting endangered species to save them is excellent.
