The best books I _read_ in 2016 - generally released in other years - are below (in no particular order). For the non-fiction books, the links lead to my reviews.

<table >
<tbody >
<tr >

<td style="border:none;" >Joe Henrich's [The Secret of Our Success: How Culture Is Driving Human Evolution, Domesticating Our Species, and Making Us Smarter](https://jasoncollins.blog/2016/11/14/henrichs-the-secret-of-our-success-how-culture-is-driving-human-evolution-domesticating-our-species-and-making-us-smarter/) (2015): A lot of interesting ideas, but left me with a lot of questions.

How Can We Know?](https://jasoncollins.blog/2016/08/25/tetlocks-expert-political-judgment-how-good-is-it-how-can-we-know/) (2006): I re-read this before reading Tetlock's also good [Superforecasting](https://jasoncollins.blog/2016/09/12/tetlock-and-gardners-superforecasting-the-art-and-science-of-prediction/), but Expert Political Judgement is the superior of the two books.
