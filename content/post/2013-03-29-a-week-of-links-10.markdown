Links this week:



	
  1. [An excellent review](http://www.epjournal.net/articles/throwing-out-the-mismatch-baby-with-the-paleo-bathwater-a-review-of-marlene-zuk-paleofantasy-what-evolution-really-tells-us-about-sex-diet-and-how-we-live-2/) of [Paleofantasy](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B007Q6XM1A/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=B007Q6XM1A&linkCode=as2&tag=evolvieconom-20) (which is still on my reading pile and likely to stay there for at least a few more weeks).

	
  2. [Ross Douthat in the New York Times](http://douthat.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/03/22/late-marriage-and-its-consequences/) on the marriage premium, and [Bryan Caplan's thoughts](http://econlog.econlib.org/archives/2013/03/22_short_argume.html). When the debate popped up a year ago, I [wrote this piece](https://jasoncollins.blog/2012/02/why-do-married-men-earn-more/).

	
  3. A few months ago, Andrew Gelman [wrote a blog post ](http://andrewgelman.com/2013/01/10/that-controversial-claim-that-high-genetic-diversity-or-low-genetic-diversity-is-bad-for-the-economy/)on Ashraf and Galor's [paper on genetic diversity and economic development ](https://jasoncollins.blog/2013/02/the-out-of-africa-hypothesis-human-genetic-diversity-and-comparative-economic-development/)(the [comments](http://andrewgelman.com/2013/01/10/that-controversial-claim-that-high-genetic-diversity-or-low-genetic-diversity-is-bad-for-the-economy/#comments) are worth reading). Gelman has extended that post for [publication in Chance](http://www.stat.columbia.edu/~gelman/research/published/ChanceEthics7.pdf).

	
  4. The Society for the Evolutionary Analysis in Law (SEAL) has a few interesting speakers lined up for [their annual conference](https://www4.vanderbilt.edu/seal/conferences/14th-seal-scholarship-conference/speakers-talk-abstracts/) next week.
