  8. I'm back into my habit of linking to Andrew Gelman articles every week - this time a great rant about expected utility titled "[It’s as if you went into a bathroom in a bar and saw a guy pissing on his shoes, and instead of thinking he has some problem with his aim, you suppose he has a positive utility for getting his shoes wet](http://andrewgelman.com/2014/09/10/notion-geocentric-universe-come-criticism-copernican-astronomy/)"
