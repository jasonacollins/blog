The best books I <em>read</em> in 2022 - generally released in other years - were:

- .

It's a short list. There just wasn't much I was inspired by this year. Maybe I'm getting old and grumpy. Perhaps my book selection was not great. What I pick up next is too often dictated by mood rather than a plan.

Below is the full list of books that I read in 2022 (starred if I have read before). The volume of my reading of books cover-to-cover continues to fall year-on-year, with XX total (XX non-fiction, XX fiction). I have read to the kids (48 of them!).

I've also included a list of books commenced but abandoned. There are 9 on that list. I want to be more ruthless in stopping reading books that aren't worth the effort. There are more than enough on the reading pile to justify moving on if the gain isn't there. As you can see from that short list, abandoning books is a skill I need to build.
