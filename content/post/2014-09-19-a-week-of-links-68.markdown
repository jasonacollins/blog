Links this week:






	
  1. [The Genetic Genealogist responds](http://www.thegeneticgenealogist.com/2014/09/13/response-genetic-testing-article-vox/) to Vox's tabloid piece on genetic testing.

	
  2. Attempts to correct false claims often entrench them - the backfire effect. [But telling politicians they will be fact checked still reduced their number of lies](http://www.motherjones.com/politics/2014/09/inquiring-minds-brendan-nyhan-fact-checking-2014-election). [Update: There is probably no backfire effect.]

	
  3. [Razib on heritability](http://www.unz.com/gnxp/hoping-for-high-heritability-of-iq/). Low heritability doesn't make it easier to shape our children - once we're above some minimum thresholds, we don't really know what works.

	
  4. [Tyler Cowen suggests the gender gap will close](http://www.nytimes.com/2014/09/14/upshot/gauging-the-gender-gap-present-and-future.html?_r=0&abt=0002&abg=0). I'm not so sure.

	
  5. [Violence in chimps an evolutionary adaptation](http://www.bostonglobe.com/news/science/2014/09/17/war-innate-chimpanzees-lethal-attacks-may-provide-advantage-eliminating-rivals/V3lwx38s1RId3ZACQmnuiJ/story.html?rss_id=Top-GNP).

	
  6. [Another study showing low social mobility](http://ereh.oxfordjournals.org/content/early/2014/09/15/ereh.heu015.short?rss=1). HT: [Jayman](https://twitter.com/JayMan471)

	
  7. [A great collection of papers](http://www.psy.miami.edu/ehblab/controversies.html) on altruism, reciprocity and the glucose model of self control.
