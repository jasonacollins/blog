Links this week:






	
  1. [On the misplaced politics of behavioral policy interventions](http://home.uchicago.edu/~/davetannenbaum/documents/partisan%20nudge%20bias.pdf). And [hawkish biases](http://econlog.econlib.org/archives/2015/04/kahneman_and_re.html).

	
  2. Noah Smith v Bryan Caplan on education signalling - [1](http://www.bloombergview.com/articles/2015-04-27/economists-need-to-give-up-on-overused-signaling-fad), [2](http://econlog.econlib.org/archives/2015/04/educational_sig_1.html) and [3](http://noahpinionblog.blogspot.com.au/2015/04/a-follow-up-on-college-and-signaling.html). I believe signalling is an important part of the education story, but Smith's argument about _costly_ signalling is on point.

	
  3. [Robert Trivers on his friends and enemies](http://www.unz.com/article/vignettes-of-famous-evolutionary-biologists-large-and-small/). HT: [Razib](http://www.unz.com/gnxp/robert-trivers-friends-and-enemies/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=robert-trivers-friends-and-enemies)




And if you missed it, my one post this last week:






	
  1. [Bad nudges toward organ donation](https://jasoncollins.blog/2015/04/27/bad-nudges-organ-donation-edition/).


Life continues to be busy, so posting will continue to be sparse.
