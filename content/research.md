# My research

My research and writing tend to revolve around the following themes:

- The intersection of economics and evolutionary biology (comprising most of the papers below)
- How behavioural economics could be better, be that better underlying theory, better research practices or better applied work
- The use of algorithms to supplant human judgment, particularly using simple heuristics, and how to establish the right human-algorithm mix.

Below is my academic work (largely neglected since 2016, although about to be revived with my return to academia in 2022). For my non-academic writing, see [here](/writing/).

## PhD

I completed a PhD at the University of Western Australia. My thesis can be downloaded [here](https://research-repository.uwa.edu.au/en/publications/essays-on-human-evolution-and-economic-growth), although most of the chapters that make up the thesis were published and are listed above. You can access the examiner reports [here](/phd-thesis-passed/).
