      <p>From <a href="https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/cXzTpSiCrNGzeoRAz/conjunction-controversy-or-how-they-nail-it-down">Eliezer Yudkowsky on Less Wrong</a> (a few years old, but worth revisiting in the light of my <a href="https://jasoncollins.blog/2019/04/01/gigerenzer-versus-kahneman-and-tversky-the-1996-face-off/">recent Gigerenzer v Kahneman and Tversky post</a>):</p>
<blockquote>
<p>When a single experiment seems to show that subjects are guilty of some horrifying sinful bias - such as thinking that the proposition &ldquo;Bill is an accountant who plays jazz&rdquo; <a href="https://www.lesswrong.com/lw/ji/conjunction_fallacy/">has a higher probability</a> than &ldquo;Bill is an accountant&rdquo; - people may try to dismiss (not <a href="https://www.lesswrong.com/lw/ig/i_defy_the_data/">defy</a>) the experimental data. Most commonly, by questioning whether the subjects interpreted the experimental instructions in some unexpected fashion - perhaps they misunderstood what you meant by &ldquo;more probable&rdquo;.</p>
<p>Experiments are <a href="https://www.lesswrong.com/lw/ig/i_defy_the_data/">not beyond questioning</a>; on the other hand, there should always exist some mountain of evidence which suffices to convince you.</p>
<p>&hellip;</p>
<p>Here is (probably) the single most questioned experiment in the literature of heuristics and biases, which I reproduce here exactly as it appears in Tversky and Kahneman (1982):</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Linda is 31 years old, single, outspoken, and very bright. She majored in philosophy. As a student, she was deeply concerned with issues of discrimination and social justice, and also participated in anti-nuclear demonstrations.</p>
<p>Please rank the following statements by their probability, using 1 for the most probable and 8 for the least probable:</p>
<p>(5.2)  Linda is a teacher in elementary school.
(3.3)  Linda works in a bookstore and takes Yoga classes.
(2.1)  Linda is active in the feminist movement. (F)
(3.1)  Linda is a psychiatric social worker.
(5.4)  Linda is a member of the League of Women Voters.
(6.2)  Linda is a bank teller. (T)
(6.4)  Linda is an insurance salesperson.
(4.1)  Linda is a bank teller and is active in the feminist movement. (T &amp; F)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>(The numbers at the start of each line are the mean ranks of each proposition, lower being more probable.)</p>
<p>How do you know that subjects did not interpret &ldquo;Linda is a bank teller&rdquo; to mean &ldquo;Linda is a bank teller and is not active in the feminist movement&rdquo;? For one thing, dear readers, I offer the observation that most bank tellers, even the ones who participated in anti-nuclear demonstrations in college, are probably not active in the feminist movement. So, even so, Teller should rank above Teller &amp; Feminist.  &hellip;  But the researchers did not stop with this observation; instead, in Tversky and Kahneman (1983), they created a between-subjects experiment in which either the conjunction or the two conjuncts were deleted. Thus, in the between-subjects version of the experiment, each subject saw either (T&amp;F), or (T), but not both. With a total of five propositions ranked, the mean rank of (T&amp;F) was 3.3 and the mean rank of (T) was 4.4, N=86. Thus, the fallacy is not due solely to interpreting &ldquo;Linda is a bank teller&rdquo; to mean &ldquo;Linda is a bank teller and not active in the feminist movement.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&hellip;</p>
<p>Another way of knowing whether subjects have misinterpreted an experiment is to ask the subjects directly. Also in Tversky and Kahneman (1983), a total of 103 medical internists &hellip; were given problems like the following:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A 55-year-old woman had pulmonary embolism documented angiographically 10 days after a cholecstectomy. Please rank order the following in terms of the probability that they will be among the conditions experienced by the patient (use 1 for the most likely and 6 for the least likely). Naturally, the patient could experience more than one of these conditions.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Dyspnea and hemiparesis</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Calf pain</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Pleuritic chest pain</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Syncope and tachycardia</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Hemiparesis</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Hemoptysis</p>
</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>As Tversky and Kahneman note, &ldquo;The symptoms listed for each problem included one, denoted B, that was judged by our consulting physicians to be nonrepresentative of the patient&rsquo;s condition, and the conjunction of B with another highly representative symptom denoted A. In the above example of pulmonary embolism (blood clots in the lung), dyspnea (shortness of breath) is a typical symptom, whereas hemiparesis (partial paralysis) is very atypical.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In indirect tests, the mean ranks of A&amp;B and B respectively were 2.8 and 4.3; in direct tests, they were 2.7 and 4.6. In direct tests, subjects ranked A&amp;B above B between 73% to 100% of the time, with an average of 91%.</p>
<p>The experiment was designed to eliminate, in four ways, the possibility that subjects were interpreting B to mean &ldquo;only B (and not A)&rdquo;. First, carefully wording the instructions:  &ldquo;&hellip;the probability that they will be among the conditions experienced by the patient&rdquo;, plus an explicit reminder, &ldquo;the patient could experience more than one of these conditions&rdquo;. Second, by including indirect tests as a comparison. Third, the researchers afterward administered a questionnaire:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In assessing the probability that the patient described has a particular symptom X, did you assume that (check one):
X is the <em>only</em> symptom experienced by the patient?
X is <em>among</em> the symptoms experienced by the patient?</p>
<p>60 of 62 physicians, asked this question, checked the second answer.</p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>Fourth and finally, as Tversky and Kahneman write, &ldquo;An additional group of 24 physicians, mostly residents at Stanford Hospital, participated in a group discussion in which they were confronted with their conjunction fallacies in the same questionnaire. The respondents did not defend their answers, although some references were made to &lsquo;the nature of clinical experience.&rsquo;  Most participants appeared surprised and dismayed to have made an elementary error of reasoning.&rdquo;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&hellip;</p>
<p>Does the conjunction fallacy arise because subjects misinterpret what is meant by &ldquo;probability&rdquo;? This can be excluded by offering students bets with payoffs. In addition to the colored dice discussed yesterday, subjects have been asked which possibility they would prefer to bet $10 on in the classic Linda experiment. This did reduce the incidence of the conjunction fallacy, but only to 56% (N=60), which is still more than half the students.</p>
<p>But the ultimate proof of the conjunction fallacy is also the most elegant. In the conventional interpretation of the Linda experiment, subjects <em>substitute judgment of representativeness for judgment of probability:</em> Their feelings of similarity between each of the propositions and Linda&rsquo;s description, determines how plausible it <em>feels</em> that each of the propositions is true of Linda. &hellip;</p>
<p>You just take another group of experimental subjects, and ask them how much each of the propositions &ldquo;resembles&rdquo; Linda. This was done - see Kahneman and Frederick (2002) - and the <em>correlation</em> between representativeness and probability was nearly perfect.  0.99, in fact.</p>
<p>&hellip;</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.lesswrong.com/lw/ji/conjunction_fallacy/">conjunction fallacy</a> is probably the single most questioned bias ever introduced, which means that it now ranks among the best replicated. The conventional interpretation has been nearly absolutely nailed down.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>There are a few additional experiments in Yudkowsky’s post that I have not replicated here.</p>
