      <description>The best books I read in 2020 - generally released in other years - were:
 Albert Camus, The Plague Tom Chivers, The AI Does Not Hate You: Superintelligence, Rationality and the Race to Save the World: Great introduction to and history of the rationalist community. Melanie Mitchell, Artificial Intelligence, A Guide for Thinking Humans: Mitchell is too easy on humans, but a fair examination of where we are with AI and some great explanations of various AI approaches.</description>

      <description>In my previous posts on loss aversion (here, here and here), I foreshadowed a post on how &amp;ldquo;ergodicity economics&amp;rdquo; might shed some light on whether we need loss aversion to explain people&amp;rsquo;s choices under uncertainty. This was to be that post, but the background material that I drafted is long enough to be a stand alone piece. I&amp;rsquo;ll turn to the application of ergodicity economics to loss aversion in a future post.</description>

      <title>The case against loss aversion</title>

      <description>Summary: Much of the evidence for loss aversion is weak or ambiguous. The endowment effect and status quo bias are subject to multiple alternative explanations, including inertia. There is possibly better evidence for loss aversion in the response to risky bets, but what emerges does not appear to be a general principle of loss aversion. Rather, “loss aversion” is a conditional effect that most typically emerges when rejecting the bet is not the status quo and the stakes are material.</description>

      <title>What can we infer about someone who rejects a 50:50 bet to win $110 or lose $100? The Rabin paradox explored</title>

      <description>Consider the following claim:
 We don&amp;rsquo;t need loss aversion to explain a person&amp;rsquo;s decision to reject a 50:50 bet to win $110 or lose $100. That just simple risk aversion as in expected utility theory.
 Risk aversion is the concept that we prefer certainty to a gamble with the same expected value. For example, a risk averse person would prefer $100 for certain over a 50-50 gamble between $0 and $200, which has an expected value of $100.</description>

      <description>I am somewhat slow in posting this - the article has been up more than a week - but my latest article is up at Behavioral Scientist.
The article is basically an argument that the scrutiny we are applying to algorithmic decision making should also be applied to human decision making systems. Our objective should be good decisions, whatever the source of the decision.
The introduction to the article is below.</description>

      <title>Kahneman and Tversky’s “debatable” loss aversion assumption</title>

      <description>Loss aversion is the idea that losses loom larger than gains. It is one of the foundational concepts in the judgment and decision making literature. In Thinking, Fast and Slow, Daniel Kahneman wrote &amp;ldquo;The concept of loss aversion is certainly the most significant contribution of psychology to behavioral economics.&amp;rdquo;
Yet, over the last couple of years several critiques have emerged that question the foundations of loss aversion and whether loss aversion is a phenomena at all.</description>

      <description>From a new(ish) book by David Leiser and Yhonatan Shemesh, How We Misunderstand Economics and Why it Matters: The Psychology of Bias, Distortion and Conspiracy:
 Working memory is a cognitive buffer, responsible for the transient holding, processing, and manipulation of information. This buffer is a mental store distinct from that required to merely hold in mind a number of items and its capacity is severely limited. The complexity of reasoning that can be handled mentally by a person is bounded by the number of items that can be kept active in working memory and the number of interrelationships between elements that can be kept active in reasoning.</description>

      <description>Nick Chater&amp;rsquo;s The Mind is Flat: The Illusion of Mental Depth and the Improvised Mind is a great book.
Chater&amp;rsquo;s basic argument is that there are no &amp;lsquo;hidden depths&amp;rsquo; to our minds. The idea that we have an inner mental world with beliefs, motives and fears is just a work of imagination. As Chater puts it:
 no one, at any point in human history, has ever been guided by inner beliefs or desires, any more than any human being has been possessed by evil spirits or watched over by a guardian angel.</description>

      <description>From Eliezer Yudkowsky on Less Wrong (a few years old, but worth revisiting in the light of my recent Gigerenzer v Kahneman and Tversky post):
 When a single experiment seems to show that subjects are guilty of some horrifying sinful bias - such as thinking that the proposition &amp;ldquo;Bill is an accountant who plays jazz&amp;rdquo; has a higher probability than &amp;ldquo;Bill is an accountant&amp;rdquo; - people may try to dismiss (not defy) the experimental data.</description>

      <description>From Gerd Gigerenzer&amp;rsquo;s The bounded rationality of probabilistic mental models (PDF) (one of the papers mentioned in my recent post on the Kahneman and Tversky and Gigerenzer debate):
 Defenders and detractors of human rationality alike have tended to focus on the issue of algorithms. Only their answers differ. Here are some prototypical arguments in the current debate.
 Statistical algorithms
 Cohen assumes that statistical algorithms &amp;hellip; are in the mind, but distinguishes between not having a statistical rule and not applying such as rule, that is, between competence and performance.</description>

      <description>Through the late 1980s and early 1990s, Gerd Gigerenzer and friends wrote a series of articles critiquing Daniel Kahneman and Amos Tversky&amp;rsquo;s work on heuristic and biases. They hit hard. As Michael Lewis wrote in The Undoing Project:
 Gigerenzer had taken the same angle of attack as most of their other critics. But in Danny and Amos’s view he’d ignored the usual rules of intellectual warfare, distorting their work to make them sound even more fatalistic about their fellow man than they were.</description>

      <description>I typically find the argument that increased choice in the modern world is &amp;ldquo;tyrannising&amp;rdquo; us to be less than compelling. On this blog, I have approvingly quoted Jim Manzi&amp;rsquo;s warning against extrapolating the results of an experiment on two Saturdays in a particular store - the famous jam experiment - into &amp;ldquo;grandiose claims about the benefits of choice to society.&amp;rdquo; I recently excerpted a section from Bob Sugden&amp;rsquo;s excellent The Community of Advantage: A Behavioural Economist&amp;rsquo;s Defence of the Market on the idea that choice restriction &amp;ldquo;appeals to culturally conservative or snobbish attitudes of condescension towards some of the preferences to which markets cater.</description>

      <description>Summary: An important book describing how many experts make decisions, but with a lingering question mark about how good these decisions actually are.
 Gary Klein&amp;rsquo;s Sources of Power: How People Make Decisions is somewhat of a classic, with the version I read being a 20th anniversary edition issued by MIT Press. Klein&amp;rsquo;s work on expert decision making has reached a broad audience through Malcolm Gladwell&amp;rsquo;s Blink, and Klein&amp;rsquo;s adversarial collaboration with Daniel Kahneman (pdf) has given his work additional academic credibility.</description>

      <description>As a record largely for myself, below are some notes in review of 2018 and a few thoughts about 2019.
Writing: I started 2018 intending to post to this blog at least once a week, which I did. I set this objective as I had several long stretches in 2017 where I dropped the writing habit.
I write posts in batches and schedule in advance, so the weekly target did not require a weekly focus.</description>

      <description>I did not find Carol Dweck&amp;rsquo;s Mindset: Changing the Way You Think to Fulfil Your Potential to be a compelling translation of academic work into a popular book. To all the interesting debates concerning growth mindset - such as Scott Alexander&amp;rsquo;s series of growth mindset posts (1, 2, 3 and 4), the recent meta-analysis (with Carol Dweck response), and replication of the effect - the book adds little material that might influence your views.</description>

      <description>The best books I read in 2018 - generally released in other years - are below. Where I have reviewed, the link leads to that review.
  Nick Bostrom, Superintelligence: Paths, Dangers, Strategies (2014) - Changed my mind, and gave me a framework for thinking about the problem that I didn&amp;rsquo;t have before.
  Annie Duke, Thinking in Bets: Making Smarter Decisions When You Don&amp;rsquo;t Have All the Facts (2018) - While I have many small quibbles with the content, and it could easily have been a long-form article, I liked the overarching approach and framing.</description>

      <description>Confirmation bias
In Sources of Power: How People Make Decisions (review coming soon), Gary Klein writes:
 Kahneman, Slovic, and Tversky (1982) present a range of studies showing that decision makers use a variety of heuristics, simple procedures that usually produce an answer but are not foolproof. &amp;hellip; The research strategy was not to demonstrate how poorly we make judgments but to use these findings to uncover the cognitive processes underlying judgments of likelihood.</description>

      <description>From the abstract of an interesting paper Heuristics as Bayesian inference under extreme priors by Paula Parpart and colleagues:
 Simple heuristics are often regarded as tractable decision strategies because they ignore a great deal of information in the input data. One puzzle is why heuristics can outperform full-information models, such as linear regression, which make full use of the available information. These “less-is-more” effects, in which a relatively simpler model outperforms a more complex model, are prevalent throughout cognitive science, and are frequently argued to demonstrate an inherent advantage of simplifying computation or ignoring information.</description>

      <description>My latest contribution at Behavioral Scientist is up. Here&amp;rsquo;s an excerpt:
 Modern discussions of whether humans will be replaced by algorithms typically frame the problem as a choice between humans on one hand or complex statistical and machine learning models on the other. For problems such as image recognition, this is probably the right frame. Yet much of the past success of algorithms relative to human judgment points us to a third option: the mechanical application of simple models and heuristics.</description>

      <description>In reviewing Michael Lewis&amp;rsquo;s The Undoing Project, John Kay writes:
 Since Paul Samuelson’s Foundations of Economic Analysis, published in 1947, mainstream economics has focused on an axiomatic approach to rational behaviour. The overriding requirement is for consistency of choice: if A is chosen when B is available, B will never be selected when A is available. If choices are consistent in this sense, their outcomes can be described as the result of optimisation in the light of a well-defined preference ordering.</description>

      <description>From the opening of Lola Lopes&amp;rsquo;s 1991 article The Rhetoric of Irrationality (pdf) on the heuristics and biases literature:
 Not long ago, Newsweek ran a feature article describing how researchers at a major midwestern business school are exploring the process of choice in hopes of helping business executives and business students improve their &amp;lsquo;often rudimentary decision-making skills&amp;rsquo;
&amp;hellip;
[T]he researchers have, in the author&amp;rsquo;s words, &amp;lsquo;sadly&amp;rsquo; concluded that &amp;lsquo;most people&amp;rsquo; are &amp;lsquo;woefully muddled information processors who stumble along ill-chosen shortcuts to reach bad conclusions&amp;rsquo;.</description>

      <description>When genome-wide association studies (GWAS) were first used to study complex polygenic traits, the results were underwhelming. Few genes with any predictive power were found, and those that were typically explained only a fraction of the genetic effects that twin studies suggested were there.
This led to divergent responses, ranging from continued resistance to the idea that genes affect anything, to a quiet confidence that once sample sizes became large enough those genetic effects would be found.</description>

 In a famous example (at least, it’s famous if you’re into this kind of thing), in March 1951, the CIA’s Office of National Estimates published a document suggesting that a Soviet attack on Yugoslavia within the year was a “serious possibility.” Sherman Kent, a professor of history at Yale who was called to Washington, D.C. to co-run the Office of National Estimates, was puzzled about what, exactly, “serious possibility” meant.</description>

Taken in isolation, the ideas and concepts that comprise the field of behavioral finance are of very little practical use. Indeed, many of the attempts to apply these ideas amount to little more than a trite list of biases and pictures of human brains on PowerPoint slides.</description>

      <description>Summary: Interesting ideas on how to approach negotiation, but I don&amp;rsquo;t know how much weight to give them. How much expertise could be developed in hostage negotiations? Can that expertise be distilled into principles, or is much of it tacit knowledge?
 Chris Voss&amp;rsquo;s Never Split the Difference: Negotiating as if your life depended on it (written with Tahl Raz) is a distillation of Voss&amp;rsquo;s approach to negotiation, developed through 15 years negotiating hostage situations for the FBI.</description>

      <description>My conversation with Julia Galef on Rationally Speaking is out, exploring territory on how behavioural economics and its applications could be better.

      <description>Forecasting fertility is a mug&amp;rsquo;s game. Here is a picture of fertility forecasts by the US Census Bureau through the baby boom and subsequent fertility drop (from Lee and Tuljapurkar&amp;rsquo;s Population Forecasting for Fiscal Planning: Issues and Innovations). The dark line is actual, the dotted line the various forecasts.
I am not sure that the science of fertility forecasting in developed countries has made substantial progress since any of those forecasts were made.</description>

      <description>There are few books critiquing behavioural economics that I find compelling. David Levine&amp;rsquo;s Is Behavioral Economics Doomed? attacks too many straw men. Gilles Saint-Paul&amp;rsquo;s The Tyranny of Utility: Behavioral Science and the Rise of Paternalism is more an attack of the normative foundations of economics than of behavioural science. And in most of Gerd Gigerenzer&amp;rsquo;s books, while making a strong case that many of the so-called &amp;ldquo;biases&amp;rdquo; are better described as good decision-making under uncertainty, Gigerenzer often extends his defence of human decision making too far.</description>

      <description>Despite the fact that nudges, by definition, do not limit liberty, many people often have a feeling of discomfort about governments using nudges. I typically find it difficult to elicit from them what precisely is the problem, but often it comes down to the difference between freedom and autonomy.

As someone who became an economist via a brief career as a lawyer, I did notice that my kind had privileged access to the halls of government and business. Whether this was because economics can speak the language of dollars, or that we simply claimed that we had all the answers, the economists were often the first consulted (though not necessarily listened to) on how we priced, regulated, and designed our policies, services, and products.</description>

      <description>I have complained before about people being somewhat quick to label poor decisions as being due to &amp;ldquo;overconfidence&amp;rdquo;. For one, overconfidence has several distinct forms. It is a mistake to treat each as the same. Further, these forms vary in their pervasiveness.
The last time I made this complaint I drew on an article by Don Moore and Paul Healy, “The Trouble with Overconfidence” (pdf). A more recent article by Don Moore and Derek Schatz (pdf) provides some further colour on this point (HT: Julia Galef).</description>

      <description>Since first coming across Joshua Miller and Adam Sanurjo&amp;rsquo;s great work demonstrating that the hot-hand fallacy was itself a fallacy, I&amp;rsquo;ve been looking for a good way to explain simply the logic behind their argument. I haven&amp;rsquo;t found something that completely hits the mark yet, but the following explanation from Miller and Sanjurjo in The Conversation might be useful to some:
 In the landmark 1985 paper “The hot hand in basketball: On the misperception of random sequences,” psychologists Thomas Gilovich, Robert Vallone and Amos Tversky (GVT, for short) found that when studying basketball shooting data, the sequences of makes and misses are indistinguishable from the sequences of heads and tails one would expect to see from flipping a coin repeatedly.</description>

      <description>Go back ten years, and most published attempts to link specific genetic variants to a trait were false. These candidate-gene studies were your classic, yet typically rubbish, &amp;ldquo;gene for X&amp;rdquo; paper.
The proliferation of poor papers was in part because the studies were too small to discover the effects they were looking for (see here for some good videos describing the problems). As has become increasingly evident, most human traits are affected by thousands of genes, each with tiny effects.</description>

      <description>I argued in a recent post that the conceptual replication of the marshmallow test was largely successful. A single data point - whether someone can wait for a larger reward - predicts future achievement.
That replication has generated a lot of commentary. Most concerns the extension to the original study, an examination of whether the marshmallow test retained its predictive power if they accounted for factors such as the parent and child&amp;rsquo;s background (including socioeconomic status), home environment, and measures of the child&amp;rsquo;s behavioural and cognitive development.</description>

More often than not, the study deserves the criticism. But recently, the hordes have occasionally swung into action too quickly.
One series of tweets suggested that loss aversion had entered the replication crisis. A better description of the two papers that triggered the tweets is that they were the latest salvos in a decade-old debate about the interpretation of many loss aversion experiments.</description>

One of the classic stories in the field of self-fulfilling prophecies is of a computer in England that was accidently programmed incorrectly. In academic terms, it labeled a class of “bright” kids “dumb” kids and a class of supposedly “dumb” kids “bright.” And that computer report was the primary criterion that created the teachers’ paradigms about their students at the beginning of the year.</description>

I hope the book is more Kahneman than Sunstein. For all Thinking, Fast and Slow&amp;rsquo;s faults, it is a great book. You can see the thought that went into constructing it.
Sunstein&amp;rsquo;s recent books feel like research papers pulled together by a university student - which might not be too far from the truth given the fleet of research assistants at Sunstein&amp;rsquo;s command.</description>

      <description>Tyler Cowen&amp;rsquo;s Conversations with Tyler feature a section in which Cowen throws a series of ideas at the guest, and the guest responds with whether each idea is overrated or underrated. In a few of the conversations, Cowen asks about behavioural economics. Here are three responses:
Atul Gawande
COWEN: The idea of nudge.
GAWANDE: I think overrated.
COWEN: Why?
GAWANDE: I think that there are important insights in nudge units and in that research capacity, but when you step back and say, “What are the biggest problems in clinical behavior and delivery of healthcare?</description>

      <description>After my recent post on how I focus, I received a couple of requests for the blogs I follow. Here are my current subscriptions in Feedly, with occasional comments.
Some of these blogs have been in my reader for years, others I am trialling. I am usually trialling a few at any time, and tend to have a &amp;ldquo;one in, one out&amp;rdquo; pattern of subscription. It normally takes me about 10 minutes once every day or two to scan the new entries and decide which are worth reading.</description>

      <title>Thorstein Veblen&#39;s The Theory of the Leisure Class</title>

      <description>In 2011, Thorstein Veblen was ranked seventh in a poll of economists on their favourite, dead, 20th century economist. He ranked behind Keynes, Friedman, Samuelson, Hayek, Schumpeter and Galbraith. His supporters were among the least liberal (in the classical sense of the word) of the survey participants. Given his approach to consumerism, as detailed in The Theory of the Leisure Class, this is no surprise.
The Theory of the Leisure Class, published in 1899, was one of the earliest books to explore the economic assumption that people wish to consume.</description>

      <description>This post is a record of some strategies that I use to focus and be mildly productive. It also records a few other features of my lifestyle.
Why develop these strategies? On top of delivering in my day job, I have always tried to invest heavily in my human capital, and that takes a degree of focus.
The need to adopt many of the below also reflects how easily distracted I am.</description>

      <description>Michael Mauboussin&amp;rsquo;s message in More Than You Know: Finding Financial Wisdom in Unconventional Places is that we need an interdisciplinary toolkit to give us the diversity to make good decisions. This is not diversity in groups, but diversity in thinking. You need diverse cognitive tools to deal with diverse problems.
The book is a series of essays that Mauboussin wrote for a newsletter over a dozen years or so when he was at CSFB.</description>

      <description>I have mixed views about Susan Cain&amp;rsquo;s Quiet: The Power of Introverts in a World That Can&amp;rsquo;t Stop Talking.
Cain makes an important point that many of our environments, social structures and workplaces are unsuited to &amp;ldquo;introverts&amp;rdquo; (and possibly even humans in general). We could design more productive and inclusive workplaces, schools and organisations if we considered the spectrum of personality types who will work, live and learn in them.</description>

      <description>Cass Sunstein and Reid Hastie&amp;rsquo;s Wiser: Getting Beyond Groupthink to Make Groups Smarter is not an exciting read. However, it is a good catalogue of group decision-making research (leading to this post to also be somewhat of a catalogue) and worth reading for an overview.
The book&amp;rsquo;s theme is that group decisions are often better than individual decisions, but that groups have weaknesses that can impair outcomes. Much of the analysis of failures in group decision-making follows a similar theme to the research into individual judgement and decision-making, in that the research has generated a long list of &amp;ldquo;biases&amp;rdquo; that groups are subject to.</description>

      <description>What I&amp;rsquo;ve been listening to recently:
  Shane Parrish&amp;rsquo;s blog Farnam Street is a favourite of mine. His podcast The Knowledge Project is also worth a listen. I recommend the episodes featuring Michael Mauboussin (1 and 2), Rory Sutherland (if you&amp;rsquo;ve seen Rory speak before, the half hour gap between Shane&amp;rsquo;s first attempt to wind up the conversation and the end of the episode will come as no surprise), Susan Cain (I&amp;rsquo;ll write a review of Quiet shortly), Adam Grant (I disagree with his perspective on the replication crisis) and Chris Voss (I recommend Voss&amp;rsquo;s book, Never Split the Difference, which I will also review soonish).</description>

      <description>My Behavioral Scientist article, Don&amp;rsquo;t Touch The Computer was in part a reaction to Andrew McAfee and Eric Brynjolfsson&amp;rsquo;s book The Second Machine Age: Work, Progress, and Prosperity in a Time of Brilliant Technologies. In particular, I felt their story of freestyle chess as an illustration of how humans and machines can work together was somewhat optimistic.

**Robert Wiblin:** Are you a super forecaster yourself?Philip Tetlock: No. I could tell you a story about that. I actually thought I could be, I would be. So in the second year of the forecasting tournament, by which time I should’ve known enough to know this was a bad idea. I decided I would enter into the forecasting competition and make my own forecasts.</description>

      <description>My journey into understanding human decision making started when I read Michael Lewis&amp;rsquo;s Moneyball in 2005. The punchline - which, as it turns out, has been known across numerous domains since at least the 1950s - is that &amp;ldquo;expert&amp;rdquo; judgement is often outperformed by simple statistical analysis.
A couple of years later I read Malcolm Gladwell&amp;rsquo;s Blink and was diverted into the world of Gary Klein, which then led me to Kahneman and Tversky among others.</description>

      <description>In Grit: The Power of Passion and Perseverance, Angela Duckworth argues that outstanding achievement comes from a combination of passion - a focused approach to something you deeply care about - and perseverance - a resilience and desire to work hard. Duckworth calls this combination of passion and perseverance &amp;ldquo;grit&amp;rdquo;.
For Duckworth, grit is important as focused effort is required to both build skill and turn that skill into achievement. Talent plus effort leads to skill.</description>

      <description>Over at Behavioral Scientist is my latest contribution. From the intro:
The first American astronauts were recruited from the ranks of test pilots, largely due to convenience. As Tom Wolfe describes in his incredible book [_The Right Stuff_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Right_Stuff_(book)), radar operators might have been better suited to the passive observation required in the largely automated Mercury space capsules. But the test pilots were readily available, had the required security clearances, and could be ordered to report to duty.</description>

      <description>If you have read Dan Ariely&amp;rsquo;s The Upside of Irrationality, there will be few surprises for you in his TED book Payoff: The Hidden Logic That Shapes Our Motivations. TED books are designed to be slightly longer explorations of topics from TED talks, but short enough to be read in one sitting. That makes it an easy, enjoyable, but not particularly deep read, with most of the results covered in The Upside.</description>

_Mintu Turakhia (cardiologist at Stanford and Director of the Centre for Digital Health):_ AI is not new to medicine. Automated systems in healthcare have been described since the 1960s. And they went through various iterations of expert systems and neural networks and called many different things.Hanne Tidnam: In what way would those show up in the 60s and 70s.</description>

      <description>The replication crisis has ruined my ability to relax while reading a book built on social psychology foundations. The rolling sequence of interesting but small sample and possibly not replicable findings leaves me somewhat on edge. Shlomo Benartzi&amp;rsquo;s (with Jonah Lehrer) The Smarter Screen: Surprising Waysto Influence and Improve Online Behavior (2015) is one such case.
Sure, I accept there is a non-zero probability that a 30 millisecond exposure to the Apple logo could make someone more creative than exposure to the IBM logo.</description>

Below are some interesting sections of Ormerod&amp;rsquo;s review.
First, on the incorporation of psychology into economics:

      <description>One interesting thread to Don Norman’s excellent The Design of Everyday Things is the idea that while our tools and technologies are subject to constant change, humans stay the same. The fundamental psychology of humans is a relative constant.
Evolutionary change to people is always taking place, but the pace of human evolutionary change is measured in thousands of years. Human cultures change somewhat more rapidly over periods measured in decades or centuries.</description>

      <description>Much of the storytelling about the future and humans and machines runs with a theme that machines will not replace us, but that we will work with machines to create a combination greater than either alone. If you have heard the freestyle chess example, which now seems to be everywhere, you will understand the idea. (See my article in Behavioral Scientist if you haven’t.)
An interesting angle to this relationship is just how unsuited some of our existing human-machine combinations are for the unique skills of a human brings.</description>

      <description>A typical story in Charles Perrow’s Normal Accidents: Living with High-Risk Technologies runs like this.
We start with a plant, airplane, ship, biology laboratory, or other setting with a lot of components (parts, procedures, operators). Then we need two or more failures among components that interact in some unexpected way. No one dreamed that when X failed, Y would also be out of order and the two failures would interact so as to both start a fire and silence the fire alarm.</description>

[I]n many areas of life we demand action when inaction would serve us better.The most obvious example is in finance, where too many retail investors trade far too often. One study, by Brad Barber and Terrance Odean, found that the more retail investors traded, the further behind the market they lagged: active traders underperformed by more than 6 percentage points (a third of total returns) while the laziest investors enjoyed the best performance.</description>

Juice refers to the layer of surface feedback that sits above the game’s rules. It isn’t essential to the game, but it’s essential to the game’s success. Without juice, the same game loses its charm. Think of candies replaced by gray bricks and none of the reinforcing sights and sounds that make the game fun. ...Juice is effective in part because it triggers very primitive parts of the brain.</description>

      <description>Greg Ip&amp;rsquo;s framework in Foolproof: Why Safety Can Be Dangerous and How Danger Makes Us Safe is the contrast between what he calls the ecologists and engineers. Engineers seek to use the sum of our human knowledge to make us safer and the world more stable. Ecologists recognise that the world is complex and that people adapt, meaning that many of our solutions will have unintended consequences that can be worse than the problems we are trying to solve.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve pointed out several times on this blog the confused story about organ donation arising from Johnson and Goldstein&amp;rsquo;s Do Defaults Save Lives? (ungated pdf). Even greats such as Daniel Kahneman are not immune from misinterpreting what is going on.
Again, here&amp;rsquo;s Dan Ariely explaining the paper:
One of my favorite graphs in all of social science is the following plot from an inspiring paper by Eric Johnson and Daniel Goldstein.</description>

      <description>In her interesting Weapons of Math Destruction: How Big Data Increases Inequality and Threatens Democracy, Cathy O&amp;rsquo;Neil defines Weapons of Math Destruction based on three criteria - opacity, unfairness and scale.
Opacity makes it hard to assess the fairness of mathematical models (I&amp;rsquo;ll use the term algorithms through most of this post), and it facilitates (or might even be a key component of) an algorithm&amp;rsquo;s effectiveness if it relies on naive subjects.</description>

      <description>Over at Behavioral Scientist magazine my second article, Rationalizing the &amp;lsquo;Irrational&amp;rsquo;, is up.
In the article I suggest that an evolutionary biology lens can give us some insight into what drives peoples&#39; actions. By understanding someone&amp;rsquo;s actual objectives, we are better able to determine whether their actions are likely to achieve their goals. Are they are behaving &amp;ldquo;rationally&amp;rdquo;?
Although the major thread of the article is evolutionary, in some ways that is not the main point.</description>

      <description>In preparation for my recent column in The Behavioral Scientist, which opened with the story of world chess champion Garry Kasparov&amp;rsquo;s defeat by the computer Deep Blue, I read Kasparov&amp;rsquo;s recently released Deep Thinking: Where Machine Intelligence Ends and Human Creativity Begins.
Despite the title and Kasparov&amp;rsquo;s interesting observations on the computer-human relationship, Deep Thinking is more a history of man versus machine in chess than a deep analysis of human or machine intelligence.</description>

      <description>My first column over at the Behavioral Scientist is live.
The column is an attempt to bring together two potentially conflicting stories.
The first is that the best decisions result from humans and machines working together. This is encapsulated in the story of freestyle chess, whereby the best software is trumped by a human-computer team.
The other is the deep literature on whether humans or algorithms make better decisions, starting with Paul Meehl&amp;rsquo;s classic Clinical Versus Statistical Prediction.</description>

The idea is that their mental resources deplete over time, and they stop thinking carefully about their decision – until having a bite replenishes their resources. The study is well-known, and often (as in the Radiolab episode) used to argue how limited free will is, and how much of our behavior is caused by influences outside of our own control.</description>

      <description>This reading list is a balance to the one-dimensional view in many popular books, TED talks, or conferences. For those who feel they have a good understanding of the literature after reading Thinking Fast and Slow, Predictably Irrational and Nudge, this is for you. [In the time since I first wrote this, it&amp;rsquo;s fair to say that the balance has swung on Twitter.]
The purpose of this reading list is not to argue that all behavioural economics or behavioural science is bunk (it&amp;rsquo;s not).</description>

      <description>I have recommended Gerd Gigerenzer, Peter Todd and the ABC Research Group&amp;rsquo;s Simple Heuristics That Make Us Smart enough times on this blog that I figured it was time to post a synopsis or review.
After re-reading it for the first time in five or so years, this book will still be high on my recommended reading list. It provides a nice contrast to the increasing use of complex machine learning algorithms for decision making, although it is that same increasing use that makes some parts of the book are seem a touch dated.</description>

      <description>My view of Pedro Domingos&amp;rsquo;s The Master Algorithm: How the Quest for the Ultimate Learning Machine Will Remake Our World depends on which part of the book I am thinking about.
The opening and the close of the book verge on techno-Panglossianism. The five chapters on the various &amp;ldquo;tribes&amp;rdquo; of machine learning, plus the chapter on learning without supervision, are excellent. And I simply don&amp;rsquo;t have the knowledge to judge the value of Domingos&amp;rsquo;s reports on his own progress to the master algorithm.</description>

One course I went through was Coursera’s Executive Data Science Specialisation, created by John Hopkins University. Billed as the qualification to allow you to run a data science team, it is made up of five &amp;ldquo;one week&amp;rdquo; courses covering the basics of data science, building data science teams and managing data analysis processes.</description>

      <description>In a sea of books describing a competition between perfectly rational decision makers and biased humans who make systematic errors in the way they decide, Brian Christian and Tom Griffiths&amp;rsquo;s Algorithms to Live By: The Computer Science of Human Decisions provides a nice contrast.
Christian and Griffiths&amp;rsquo;s decision-making benchmarks are the algorithms developed by mathematicians, computer scientists and their friends. In that world, decision making under uncertainty involves major trade-offs between efficiency, accuracy and the types of errors you are willing to accept.</description>

      <description>I suspect I would have enjoyed Cal Newport&amp;rsquo;s So Good They Can&amp;rsquo;t Ignore You more if it had been written by a grumpy armchair economist. Newport&amp;rsquo;s advice is just what you would expect that economist to give:
  Get good at what you do (build human capital), then someone might be willing to pay you for it. If you simply follow your passion but you don&amp;rsquo;t offer anything of value, you likely won&amp;rsquo;t succeed.</description>

      <description>I was triggered to write my recent posts on overconfidence and the illusion of control - pointing to doubts about the pervasiveness of these &amp;ldquo;biases&amp;rdquo; - by Phil Rosenzweig&amp;rsquo;s entertaining Left Brain, Right Stuff: How Leaders Make Winning Decisions. Part of the value of Rosenzweig&amp;rsquo;s book comes from his examination of some classic behavioural findings, as those recent posts show. But much of Rosenzweig&amp;rsquo;s major point concerns the application of behavioural findings to real-world decision making.</description>

      <description>In the spirit of my recent post on overconfidence, the illusion of control is another &amp;ldquo;bias&amp;rdquo; where imperfect information might be a better explanation for what is occurring.
The illusion of control is a common finding in psychology that people believe they can control things that they cannot. People would prefer to pick their lottery numbers than have them randomly allocated - being willing to even pay for the privilege. In laboratory games, people often report having control over outcomes that were randomly generated.</description>

      <description>In 1995 Werner De Bondt and Richard Thaler wrote &amp;ldquo;Perhaps the most robust finding in the psychology of judgment and choice is that people are overconfident.&amp;rdquo; They are hardly been alone in making such a proclamation. And looking at the evidence, they seem to have a case. Take the following examples:
 When asked to estimate the length of the Nile by providing a range the respondent is 90% sure contains the correct answer, the estimate typically contains the correct answer only 50% of the time.</description>

      <description>When humans compete against chimps in tests of working memory, information processing or strategic play, chimps often come out on top. If you briefly flash 10 digits on a screen before covering them up, a trained chimp will often better identify the order in which the numbers appeared (see here). Have us play matching pennies, and the chimp can converge on the predicted (Nash equilibrium) result faster than the slow to adapt humans.</description>

      <description>Garett Jones has built much of his excellent Hive Mind: How Your Nation&amp;rsquo;s IQ Matters So Much More Than Your Own on foundations that, while relatively well established, are likely surprising (or even uncomfortable) for some people. Here&amp;rsquo;s a quick list off the top of my head:
  High scores in one area of IQ tests tends to show up in others - be that visual, maths, vocabulary etc. The &amp;ldquo;g factor&amp;rdquo; can capture almost half of the variation in performance across the different tests.</description>

However, Mandelbrot and Hudson&amp;rsquo;s The (mis)Behaviour of Markets: A Fractal View of Risk, Ruin, and Reward offers a much clearer critique of the underpinnings of modern financial theory (there are many parts of The Black Swan where I&amp;rsquo;m still not sure I understand what Taleb is saying). Mandelbrot describes and pulls apart the contributions of Markowitz, Sharpe, Black, Scholes and friends in a way likely understandable to the intelligent lay reader.</description>

      <description>One of my favourite parts of Philip Tetlock&amp;rsquo;s Expert Political Judgment is his chapter examining the reasons for &amp;ldquo;radical skepticism&amp;rdquo; about forecasting. Radical skeptics believe that Tetlock&amp;rsquo;s mission to improve forecasting of political and economic events is doomed as the world is inherently unpredictable (beyond conceding that no expertise was required to know that war would not erupt in Scandinavia in the 1990s). Before reading Expert Political Judgment, I largely fell into this radical skeptic camp (and much of me still resides in it).</description>

      <description>Phil Rosenzweig&amp;rsquo;s The Halo Effect &amp;hellip; and the Eight Other Business Delusions That Deceive Managers is largely an exercise of shooting fish in a barrel, but is an entertaining read regardless.
The central premise of the book is that most blockbuster business books (think Good to Great), for all the claims of scientific rigour, are largely exercises in storytelling.
The problem starts because it is difficult to understand company performance, even as it unfolds before our eyes.</description>

      <description>Philip Tetlock and Dan Gardner&amp;rsquo;s Superforecasting: The Art and Science of Prediction doesn&amp;rsquo;t quite measure up to Tetlock&amp;rsquo;s superb Expert Political Judgment (read EPJ first), but it contains more than enough interesting material to make it worth the read.
The book emerged from a tournament conducted by the Intelligence Advanced Research Projects Activity (IARPA), designed to pit teams of forecasters against each other in predicting political and economic events. These teams included Tetlock&amp;rsquo;s Good Judgment Project (also run by Barbara Mellers and Don Moore), a team from George Mason University (for which I was a limited participant), and teams from MIT and the University of Michigan.</description>

      <description>A common summary of Philip Tetlock&amp;rsquo;s Expert Political Judgment: How Good Is It? How Can We Know? (2006) is that &amp;ldquo;experts&amp;rdquo; are terrible forecasters. There is some truth in that summary, but I took a few different lessons from the book. While experts are bad, others are worse. Simple algorithms and more complex models outperform experts. And importantly, forecasting itself is not a completely pointless task.
Tetlock&amp;rsquo;s book reports on what must be one of the grander undertakings in social science.</description>

      <description>Last year&amp;rsquo;s World Development Report 2015: Mind, Society and Behaviour from the World Bank documents many of what seem to be successful behavioural interventions. Many of the interventions are quite interesting and build a case that a behavioural approach can add something to development economics.
The report also rightly received some praise for including a chapter which explored the biases of development professionals. World Bank staff were shown to subjectively interpret data differently depending on the frame, to suffer from the sunk cost bias and to have little idea about the opinions of the poor people they might help.</description>

      <description>While I suggested in my post on Jonathan Last&amp;rsquo;s What to Expect When No One&amp;rsquo;s Expecting that reading about demographics in developed countries was not uplifting, the consequences described by Last could be considered pretty minor.
A slight tightening of government budgets could be dealt with by raising pension ages by a few years. Incomes may be lower than otherwise, but as Last states, &amp;ldquo;A decline in lifestyle for a middle-class American retiree might mean canceling cable, moving to a smaller apartment, and not eating out.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve recently read a couple of books on demographic trends, and there don&amp;rsquo;t seem to be a lot of silver linings in current fertility patterns in the developed world. The demographic boat takes a long time to turn around, so many short-term outcomes are already baked in.
Despite the less than uplifting subject, Jonathan Last&amp;rsquo;s What to Expect When No One&amp;rsquo;s Expecting: America&amp;rsquo;s Coming Demographic Disaster is entertaining - in some ways it is a data filled rant.</description>

My hope was that I&amp;rsquo;d find some interesting additions to my understanding of the debate, but the book tended into the pop science/self-help genre and there was rarely enough depth to add anything to the current debates (see Scott Alexander on that point).</description>

      <description>The Behavioural Economics Guide 2016 is out (including a couple of references to yours truly), with the introduction by Gerd Gigerenzer. It&amp;rsquo;s nice to see some of the debate in the area making an appearance.
Here are a few snippets from Gigerenzer&amp;rsquo;s piece. First, on heuristics:
To rethink behavioral economics, we need to bury the negative rhetoric about heuristics and the false assumption that complexity is always better. The point I want to make here is not that heuristics are always better than complex methods.</description>

      <description>A bit over four years ago I wrote a glowing review of Daniel Kahneman&amp;rsquo;s Thinking, Fast and Slow. I described it as a &amp;ldquo;magnificent book&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;one of the best books I have read&amp;rdquo;. I praised the way Kahneman threaded his story around the System 1 / System 2 dichotomy, and the coherence provided by prospect theory.
What a difference four years makes. I will still describe Thinking, Fast and Slow as an excellent book - possibly the best behavioural science book available.</description>

      <description>David Levine&amp;rsquo;s Is Behavioural Economics Doomed? is a good but slightly frustrating read. I agree with Levine&amp;rsquo;s central argument that rationality is underweighted in many applications of behavioural economics, and he provides many good examples of the power of traditional economic thinking. For someone unfamiliar with game theory, this book is in some ways a good introduction (or more particularly, to the concept of Nash equilibrium). And for some of the points, Levine shows a richness in the literature that you don&amp;rsquo;t often hear about if you only consume pop behavioural economics books.</description>

      <description>The classic Ariely, Loewenstein, and Prelec experiment (ungated pdf) ran as follows. Students are asked to think of the last two digits of their social security number - essentially a random number - as a dollar price. They are then asked whether they would be willing to buy certain consumer goods for that price or not. Finally, they are asked what is the most they would be willing to pay for each of these goods.</description>

      <description>The growth in behavioural science has given a new foundation for paternalistic government interventions. Governments now try to help &amp;ldquo;biased&amp;rdquo; humans make better decisions - from nudging them to pay their taxes on time, to constraining the size of the soda they can buy, to making them save for that retirement so far in the future.
There is no shortage of critics of these interventions. Are people actually biased? Do these interventions change behaviour or improve outcomes for the better?</description>

      <description>Below is the text of my presentation to the Sydney Behavioural Economics and Behavioural Science Meetup on 11 May 2016. The talk is aimed at an intelligent non-specialist audience. I expect the behavioural science knowledge of most attendees is drawn from popular behavioural science books and meetups such as this.
Intro
The typical behavioural science or behavioural economics event is a love-in. We all get together to laugh at people&amp;rsquo;s irrationality - that is, the irrationality of others - and opine that if only we designed the world more intelligently, people would make better decisions.</description>

**Evolutionary Biology in Economics: A Review**Jason Collins, Boris Baer and Ernst Juerg Weber
As human traits and preferences were shaped by natural selection, there is substantial potential for the use of evolutionary biology in economic analysis. In this paper, we review the extent to which evolutionary theory has been incorporated into economic research.</description>

      <description>I rate the third of Dan Ariely&amp;rsquo;s books, The Honest Truth About Dishonesty: How We Lie to Everyone - Especially Ourselves, somewhere between his first two books.
One of the strengths of Ariely&amp;rsquo;s books is that he is largely writing about his own experiments, and not simply scraping through the same barrel as every other pop behavioural science author. The Honest Truth has a smaller back catalogue of experiments to draw from than Predictably Irrational, so it sometimes meanders in the same way as The Upside of Irrationality.</description>

**The Macrogenoeconomics of Comparative Development**A vibrant literature has emerged in recent years to explore the influences of human evolution and the genetic composition of populations on the comparative economic performance of societies, highlighting the roles played by the Neolithic Revolution and the prehistoric &amp;ldquo;out of Africa&amp;rdquo; migration of anatomically modern humans in generating worldwide variations in the composition of genetic traits across populations.</description>

      <description>Ego depletion is the idea that we have a limited supply of willpower. As we use it through the day, we become depleted and more likely to experience a willpower failure.
There is a mountain of published experiments providing evidence of ego depletion. Meta-analyses of the studies have supported the concept. The typical trick in these experiments is to get someone to engage in an ego depleting task - such as resisting chocolate - and then you watch them cave in more quickly on a later task than those who haven&amp;rsquo;t been subject to the earlier ego depletion.</description>

      <description>The Advertising Effect: How to Change Behaviour by Adam Ferrier
If you&amp;rsquo;ve read a couple of behavioural economics/behavioural science books, it doesn&amp;rsquo;t take long to become bored with hearing the same experiments and examples over and over again.
Ferrier manages to largely avoid that problem. He works in advertising, so has plenty of new stories to tell, and it&amp;rsquo;s interesting to hear how advertisers go about their job (and desperately try to win the beer accounts).</description>

      <description>Tyler Cowen described Joanna Masel&amp;rsquo;s Bypass Wall Street: A Biologist&amp;rsquo;s Guide to the Rat Race as &amp;ldquo;Darwin plus Fred Hirsch on positional goods as applied to finance and portfolios. Unorthodox, interesting.&amp;rdquo;
I agree with Cowen&amp;rsquo;s description of the book as unorthodox and interesting, although I was looking forward to more Darwin and more of a biological lens. As the title of the book implies, it provides a biologist&amp;rsquo;s view on savings and investment, and Masel&amp;rsquo;s background as a biologist - she is Associate Professor of Ecology &amp;amp; Evolutionary Biology at the University of Arizona - has likely guided her as to what arguments she is sympathetic to.</description>

      <description>In The Storytelling Animal: How Stories Make Us Human, Jonathan Gottschall asks why we live and breathe stories. We are prolific storytellers. We consume movies, novels and plays. We even create stories in our sleep.
Gottschall&amp;rsquo;s argument is that our propensity to storytelling is an evolved trait that helps us navigate problems. He likens stories to flight simulators that prepare us for problems when they arise.
Here are snippets from two chapters.</description>

**Sperm use economy of honeybee (Apis mellifera) queens**Authors: Boris Baer, Jason Collins, Kristiina Maalaps, Susanne P. A. den Boer
The queens of eusocial ants, bees, and wasps only mate during a very brief period early in life to acquire and store a lifetime supply of sperm. As sperm cannot be replenished, queens have to be highly economic when using stored sperm to fertilize eggs, especially in species with large and long-lived colonies.</description>

      <description>John Kay&amp;rsquo;s Other People&amp;rsquo;s Money is generally an excellent book. Kay argues that the growth in the size of the financial system hasn&amp;rsquo;t been matched by improvements in the allocation of capital. He proposes that financial services are not as profitable as some headline numbers would suggest. And he suggests that the replacement of those who are good at meeting clients on the 19th hole with those who were good at solving complex mathematical problems was not always a good thing - sometimes clever people are the problem, particularly in a complex environment.</description>

      <description>I am sympathetic to many of Peter Thiel&amp;rsquo;s arguments in Zero to One: Notes on Startups, or How to Build the Future, but this is not a book where the arguments are buttressed with evidence to convince you they are true. Below are some random observations.
Thiel argues that competition is something a company should avoid. Competition erodes profits, so you want to be a monopoly. In some ways Thiel&amp;rsquo;s argument isn&amp;rsquo;t about avoiding competition, but a recommendation to compete in different spheres - competing to find the next monopoly, wealth, status, etc.</description>

      <description>I am in two minds about Doug Kenrick and Vlad Griskevicius&amp;rsquo;s The Rational Animal: How Evolution Made Us Smarter Than We Think. As an introduction to evolutionary psychology and the idea that evolutionary psychology could add a lot of value to economics - and behavioural economics in particular - it does a pretty good job.
On the other hand, the occasional straw man discussion of economics and the forced attempt to sex up the book kept distracting me from the central argument, so I never found myself really enjoying the reading experience.</description>

In February 2016, Brisbane will play host to an exciting gathering of economic and evolutionary thinkers who will explore the potential for a closer synthesis between evolution and economics in order to understand both the economics and biology of behaviour in contest.
The conference aims to bring together leading economists, psychologists and evolutionary biologists to explore contest behaviour in economic, political and social environments.</description>

 Please, not another bias! An evolutionary take on behavioural economics
Thank you for the invitation to speak today.
I accepted the invite because natural selection has shaped the human mind to take actions that have, in our past, tended increase reproductive success.</description>

One interesting point was about the presentation of estimates of GDP growth. The Bank of England produces quarterly forecasts of GDP growth, but when they present them graphically, they don&amp;rsquo;t include their central estimate.</description>

Companies — and other powerful actors, including lawmakers, educators and doctors — “experiment” on us without our consent every time they implement a new policy, practice or product without knowing its consequences. When Facebook started, it created a radical new way for people to share emotionally laden information, with unknown effects on their moods. And when OkCupid started, it advised users to go on dates based on an algorithm without knowing whether it worked.</description>

The Evolutionary Foundations of EconomicsAs human traits and preferences were shaped by natural selection, there is substantial potential for the use of evolutionary biology in economic analysis. In this paper, we review the extent to which evolutionary theory has been incorporated into economic research.</description>

CRM [crew resource management] as born of a realisation that in the late 20th century the most frequent cause of crashes wasn’t technical failure, but human error. Its roots go back to the Second World War, when the US army assigned a psychologist called Alphonse Chapanis to investigate a curious phenomenon. B-17 bombers kept crashing on to the runway on landing, even though there were no apparent mechanical problem with the planes.</description>

During moments of risk-taking, competition and triumph, of exuberance, there is one steroid in particular that makes its presence felt and guides our actions – testosterone. At Rockefeller University I came across a model of testosterone-fuelled behaviour that offered a tantalising explanation of trader behaviour during market bubbles, a model taken from animal behaviour called ‘the winner effect’.</description>

      <description>Last month a NYT article by Claire Cain Miller documented some of the backfires associated with family friendly policies. For instance:
Unlike many countries, the United States has few federal policies for working parents. One is the Family and Medical Leave Act of 1993, which provides workers at companies of a certain size with 12 weeks of unpaid leave.Women are 5 percent more likely to remain employed but 8 percent less likely to get promotions than they were before it became law, according to an unpublished new study by Mallika Thomas, who will be an assistant professor of economics at Cornell University.</description>

There are two major types of retirement savings arrangements. The first is defined benefit pension plans. Under these plans, a set income is paid to retirees based on factors such as years of service and final salary, with the income paid until death.</description>

      <description>I am rereading Nassim Taleb&amp;rsquo;s Antifragile: Things That Gain from Disorder. The first time I read it was during a series of long-haul flights, so some parts of the book are almost unfamiliar.
The below passage is among my favourites. I try to avoid getting sucked into the news cycle and am constantly looking for useful ways to control the flow of information I consume.
[T]hose in corporations or in policy making (like Fragilista Greenspan) who are endowed with a sophisticated data-gathering department and are therefore getting a lot of “timely” statistics are capable of overreacting and mistaking noise for information—Greenspan kept an eye on such fluctuations as the sales of vacuum cleaners in Cleveland to, as they say, “get a precise idea about where the economy is going,” and of course he micromanaged us into chaos.</description>

      <description>If you&amp;rsquo;re familiar with the literature, this is unsurprising. A meta-analysis in Nature Genetics of 2,748 twin study publications points to the strong role of genetics and the weak role of family influence (a major component of &amp;ldquo;shared environment&amp;rdquo;) in shaping human traits.

Despite a century of research on complex traits in humans, the relative importance and specific nature of the influences of genes and environment on human traits remain controversial.</description>

      <description>It&amp;rsquo;s a favourite behavioural science story. Countries that have opt-in organ donation have lower rates of organ donation than countries where you have to opt out of being an organ donor. If we change the way the choice is framed from opt in to opt out, we can dramatically increase the rate of organ donation.
Except, it&amp;rsquo;s not that simple. For countries where there is an opt-out system, there is no simple point where the choice is presented to them as the default and they can easily tick the box to be removed from the organ donation register.</description>

In Scenario A a trolley is barreling down the tacks toward five people who will be killed unless the trolley is stopped. Luckily, there is a fork in the tracks, and by simply pulling a lever, the trolley can be diverted onto a second set of tracks. Unfortunately there is a single person in the path of the tolled on this track who will be killed if you pull the lever.</description>

This project will provide evidence of how accurately peer prediction markets can forecast replication of scientific experiments in economics.In order to incentivize prediction market activity, and collect evidence on actual replication, eighteen (18) prominently published studies in experimental economics were chosen for trading in prediction markets, followed by replication. They are laboratory studies, using student participants, that were published in the American Economic Review (AER) or in the Quarterly Journal of Economics (QJE) in the years 2011 to 2014, testing specific hypotheses using between-subjects designs.</description>

      <description>Last week I posted on Owen Jones&amp;rsquo;s 2000 article Time-Shifted Rationality and the Law of Law&amp;rsquo;s Leverage: Behavioral Economics Meets Behavioral Biology and his argument that behavioural economics (and law) requires the theoretical backbone of evolutionary biology.
The second half of that article has a neat idea - what Jones calls the law of law&amp;rsquo;s leverage. The basic idea is that the effectiveness of laws will vary with the adaptiveness (in ancestral environments) of the behaviour the law is trying to change.</description>

      <description>Two interesting education snippets.
First, Brookings has released a new report that looks at the gender gap in reading:
Girls outscore boys on practically every reading test given to a large population. And they have for a long time. A 1942 Iowa study found girls performing better than boys on tests of reading comprehension, vocabulary, and basic language skills. Girls have outscored boys on every reading test ever given by the National Assessment of Educational Progress (NAEP)—the first long term trend test was administered in 1971—at ages nine, 13, and 17.</description>

      <description>I often complain that behavioural economics (behavioural science) often appears to be no more than a loosely connected set of heuristics and biases, crying out for theoretical unification. Evolutionary biology is likely the source of that unification.
Over the last few years, I&amp;rsquo;ve spotted the occasional attempt to analyse a bias through an evolutionary lens. But late last year, I came across Owen D Jones, a professor of law and professor of biological sciences at Vanderbilt University.</description>

      <description>The Economist discusses a new OECD report on a growing gender gap in schools:
It is a problem that would have been unimaginable a few decades ago. Until the 1960s boys spent longer and went further in school than girls, and were more likely to graduate from university. Now, across the rich world and in a growing number of poor countries, the balance has tilted the other way. ...The reversal is laid out in a report published on March 5th by the OECD, a Paris-based rich-country think-tank.</description>

      <description>I have been working through The Behavioral Foundations of Public Policy, edited by Eldar Shafir, and have mixed views so far. As I go through, I will note some interesting points.
The opening substantive chapter by Curtis Hardin and Mahzarin Banaji is on bias - and particularly implicit bias. Implicit biases are unconscious negative (or positive) attitudes towards a person or group. Most people who claim (and believe) they are not biased because they don&amp;rsquo;t show explicit bias will nevertheless have implicit bias that affects their actions.</description>

      <description>I have just finished Leo Tolstoy&amp;rsquo;s War and Peace, and along the way marked a couple of passages.
The first two fit with the story that much behavioural science is formalisation of common sense. First, hindsight bias:
In historical works on the year 1812 French writers are very fond of saying that Napoleon felt the danger of extending his line, that he sought a battle and that his marshals advised him to stop at Smolensk, and of making similar statements to show that the danger of the campaign was even then understood.</description>

      <description>Late last year I went to a presentation by Schlomo Benartzi on how people think differently when they are using a screen. The punchline was that many of the classic behavioural biases do not play out as expected in digital mediums. (Benartzi has a book on this topic, co-authored with Jonah Lehrer, coming out later this year.)
One example Benartzi gave involved defaults. The standard understanding is that defaults are powerful ways to influence behaviour - people will tend to stick to them.</description>

      <description>&amp;ldquo;Nudges&amp;rdquo; change the decision environment so that people make &amp;ldquo;better&amp;rdquo; decisions, while retaining freedom of choice. Fitting within what Cass Sunstein and Richard Thaler call &amp;ldquo;libertarian paternalism&amp;rdquo;, nudges are often framed as alternatives to coercive measures. If you can nudge most people toward the &amp;ldquo;right&amp;rdquo; decision through the way you frame the choice, the coercive measure is not required.

      <description>In social science, a myriad of factors can affect outcomes. Think of all the factors claimed to affect school achievement - student characteristics such as intelligence, conscientiousness, patience and willingness to work hard, parental characteristics such as income and education, and then there is genetics, socioeconomic status, school peers, teacher quality, class size, local crime and so on.
In assessing the effect of any policy or program, researchers typically attempt to control for these confounding factors.</description>

I&amp;rsquo;ll post a review of Uncontrolled later this week, but in the meantime, Manzi provides an interesting take on the Donohue-Levitt abortion-crime hypothesis. Their hypothesis is that abortion reduces crime as unwanted children are more likely to become criminals.</description>

      <description>The famous Dunning-Kruger effect, in the words of Dunning and Kruger, is a bias where:
People tend to hold overly favorable views of their abilities in many social and intellectual domainsin part, because:
[P]eople who are unskilled in these domains suffer a dual burden: Not only do these people reach erroneous conclusions and make unfortunate choices, but their incompetence robs them of the metacognitive ability to realize it.There have been plenty of critiques and explanations over the years, including an article by Marian Krajc and Andreas Ortmann who argue the overestimation of ability is partly a signal extraction problem.</description>

      <description>Cleaning up some notes recently, I was reminded of another interesting piece from Gerd Gigerenzer&amp;rsquo;s Rationality for Mortals:
Is perfect memory desirable, without error? The answer seems to be no. The “sins” of our memory seem to be good errors, that is, by-products (“spandrels”) of a system adapted to the demands of our environments. In this view, forgetting prevents the sheer mass of details stored in an unlimited memory from critically slowing down and inhibiting the retrieval of the few important experiences.</description>

So, the birth rate problem is worse than forecast in 1976, 1986, 1992 and 1997. However, the birth rate is higher than was forecast in 2002 and 2006 - so has surprised on the upside.

      <description>Are two-thirds of cancer due to bad luck as many recent headlines have stated? Well, we don&amp;rsquo;t really know.
The paper that triggered these headlines found that two-thirds of the variation in log of cancer risk can be explained by the number of cell divisions. More cell divisions - more opportunity for &amp;ldquo;bad luck&amp;rdquo;.
But, as pointed out by Bob O&amp;rsquo;Hara and GrrlScientist, an explanation for variation in incidence is not an explanation for the absolute numbers.</description>

      <description>The basis of David Colander and Roland Kupers&amp;rsquo;s book Complexity and the Art of Public Policy: Solving Society&amp;rsquo;s Problems from the Bottom Up is that the economy is a complex system and it should be examined through a complexity frame.
A complex system comprises many parts that interact in a nonlinear manner. You can&amp;rsquo;t simply add the parts. While you might expect this would lead to chaos, emergent behaviour in complex systems can lead to what appears to be an order state.</description>

      <description>Another clip from David Colander and Roland Kupers&amp;rsquo;s Complexity and the Art of Public Policy: Solving Society&amp;rsquo;s Problems from the Bottom Up - a nice description of how two often confused terms, complexity and chaos, differ and interrelate:
Chaos theory is a field of applied mathematics whose roots date back to the nineteenth century, to French mathematician Henri Poincaré. Poincaré was a prolific scientist and philosopher who contributed to an extraordinary range of disciplines; among his many accomplishments is Poincaré’s conjecture that deals with a famous problem in physics first formulated by Newton in the eighteenth century: the three body problem.</description>

      <description>Following my post last week on the need for more complicated models in economics, a new paper in PLOS Biology argues for the importance of mathematical models in showing &amp;lsquo;proof of concept&amp;rsquo; (HT: Santa Fe Institute News). The authors write:
Proof-of-concept models, used in many fields, test the validity of verbal chains of logic by laying out the specific assumptions mathematically. The results that follow from these assumptions emerge through the principles of mathematics, which reduces the possibility of logical errors at this step of the process.</description>

      <description>I am half way through David Colander and Roland Kupers&amp;rsquo;s book Complexity and the Art of Public Policy: Solving Society&amp;rsquo;s Problems from the Bottom Up. Overall, it&amp;rsquo;s a good book, although the authors are somewhat slow to get to the point and there are plenty of lines that perplex or annoy (Arnold Kling seemed to have a similar reaction).
I&amp;rsquo;ll review later, but one interesting line in the book is that under a complexity approach, you may need more complicated mathematical models than used in neoclassical economics.</description>

      <description>Biologists are usually among the first to tell me that economists rely on unrealistic assumptions about human decision making. They laugh at the idea that people are rational optimisers who care only about maximising consumption.
Some of the points are undoubtedly correct. Humans do not care primarily about consumption. They seek mates or other objectives related to their fitness. And of course, humans do not solve complex optimisation problems with constraints in their heads.</description>

      <description>Gerd Gigerenzer is a strong advocate of the idea that simple heuristics can make us smart. We don&amp;rsquo;t need complex models of the world to make good decisions.
The classic example is the gaze heuristic. Rather than solving a complex equation to catch a ball, which requires us to know the ball&amp;rsquo;s speed and trajectory and the effect of the wind, a catcher can simply run to keep the ball at a constant angle in the air, leading them to the point where it will land.</description>

In the first essay, Gigerenzer provides four categories of approaches to analysing decision making - unbounded rationality, optimisation under constraints, cognitive illusions (heuristics and biases) and ecological rationality. At the end of this post, I&amp;rsquo;ll propose a fifth.</description>

The strawman punchline for the Prospect article is &amp;ldquo;It&amp;rsquo;s delusional to believe that everything can be explained by genetics&amp;rdquo;.
The article has drawn a response from one of the people named in the article, Dominic Cummings. Ball suggests that Cummings presents &amp;ldquo;genetics as a fait accompli – if you don’t have the right genes, nothing much will help&amp;rdquo;, although this statement suggests Ball had not invested much effort getting across Cummings&amp;rsquo;s actual position (as contained in this now infamous essay).</description>

      <description>In my review of E.O. Wilson&amp;rsquo;s The Social Conquest of Earth, I quoted this passage which captures Wilson&amp;rsquo;s conception of the origin of cooperation in humans.
Selection at the individual level tends to create competitiveness and selfish behaviour among group members - in status, mating, and the securing of resources. In opposition, selection between groups tends to create selfless behavior, expressed in greater generosity and altruism, which in turn promote stronger cohesion and strength of the group as a whole.</description>

There is no dispute between me and Richard Dawkins and there never has been, because he’s a journalist, and journalists are people that report what the scientists have found and the arguments I’ve had have actually been with scientists doing research.</description>

College students who hand in exams that will earn them Ds and Fs tend to think their efforts will be worthy of far higher grades; low-performing chess players, bridge players, and medical students, and elderly people applying for a renewed driver’s license, similarly overestimate their competence by a long shot.</description>

In that post, I linked to a series of videos from the first session on the effect of genes on socioeconomic aggregates.
Over the last couple of days, I watched the videos from the session on Genome Wide Association Studies (GWAS). As for the first set of videos, they are technical (as you might expect for a bunch of academics) - particularly the questions - but cover some important points.</description>

      <description>A classic story on the play-list of many behavioural economics presentations is why you can&amp;rsquo;t find taxis on rainy days. The story is based on the idea that taxi drivers work to an income target. If driver wages are high due to high demand for taxis, such as when it rains, they will reach their income target earlier and go home for the day. The result is you can&amp;rsquo;t find a taxi when you need one most.</description>

It is used once in The Theory of Moral Sentiments (1759) and The Wealth of Nations (1776) - both of those I knew. The third time comes from a posthumously published (1795) essay The History of Astronomy, written before The Theory of Moral Sentiments.</description>

But what does the chart actually tell us? In a perfect meritocracy, the smartest students will score the highest. But as intelligence is heritable, the smarter kids will tend to have smarter and higher income patterns, giving us the pattern we see in the chart.</description>

      <description>Perusing through some of my bookmarks in Steven Pinker&amp;rsquo;s The Better Angels of Our Nature: Why Violence Has Declined, I was reminded of the following passage. It&amp;rsquo;s worth sharing.
 The West was eventually tamed not just by flinty-eyed marshals and hanging judges but by an influx of women. The Hollywood westerns’ “prim pretty schoolteacher[s] arriving in Roaring Gulch” captures a historical reality. Nature abhors a lopsided sex ratio, and women in eastern cities and farms eventually flowed westward along the sexual concentration gradient.</description>

      <description>In 2007’s A Farewell to Alms: A Brief Economic History of the World, Gregory Clark argued that the higher fertility of the rich in pre-industrial England sowed the seeds for the Industrial Revolution. As children resemble their parents, the increased number of prudent, productive people made possible the modern economic era.
Part of the controversy underlying Clark’s argument – made stark by Clark in articles and speeches following A Farewell to Alm’s publication - was that he considered there may be a genetic basis to the transmitted traits.</description>

      <description>In the Gerd Gigerenzer versus Daniel Kahneman wars, most of the projectiles seem to fly one way. Gigerenzer attacks directly, Kahneman expends little effort in defence.
As one test of whether my impression was correct, I searched Kahneman&amp;rsquo;s Thinking, Fast and Slow for how many times Kahneman directly mentions Gigerenzer. The answer is six, once in the index and five times in the notes. Gigerenzer is not alluded to in the main text.</description>

      <description>Sendhil Mullainathan and Eldar Shafir’s Scarcity: Why Having Too Little Means So Muchis full of interesting insight and experimental results. It presents a novel way of looking at scarcity that extends beyond the typical analysis in economics, the original “science of scarcity”, and will certainly change the way I think about it.
But by the time I reached the end of the book, I was not entirely satisfied. I have new buzzwords and some interesting experiments to think about, but I’m not convinced Mullainathan and Shafir have presented a coherent new perspective on how the world works.</description>

But there was something about this book that grated at times, especially against the backdrop of his other fantastic work.
In part, I continue to be perplexed by Gigerenzer&amp;rsquo;s ongoing war against nudges (as I have posted about before), despite his recommendations falling into the nudge category themselves.</description>

      <description>The history of twin studies is littered with attempts to discredit them - such as this bit of rubbish. Yet every challenge has been met, with a couple of newish studies knocking off another.
The basic idea of twin studies is that by comparing the similarity of fraternal twins to the similarity of identical twins, you can tease out the influence of their genes. Twin studies tend to find that most behaviours have heritability of at least 0.</description>

What I’ve been thinking might actually be going on is that adolescence is something unavoidable that emerges not because it’s so cool and adaptive, but because the adaptive thing is wait a long, long time before you have fully wired up your frontal cortex.</description>

      <description>Yesterday was day one of the Marketing Science Ideas Xchange (MSiX). As I mentioned in a previous post, it has been an interesting opportunity to see behavioural science outside of the academic and economics environments I am used to. There were a lot of interesting presentations, and a lot of good books were mentioned along the way.
First, a couple of blasts from the past: Claude Hopkins&amp;rsquo;s Scientific Advertising (if the one dollar Amazon price is prohibitive, it doesn&amp;rsquo;t take much searching to find some free pdf versions) and Vance Packard&amp;rsquo;s The Hidden Persuaders.</description>

      <description>Since I first came across it, I have been a fan of Gerd Gigerenzer’s work. But I have always been slightly perplexed by the effort he expends framing his work in opposition to behavioural science and “nudges”. Most behavioural science aficionados who are aware of Gigerenzer’s work are fans of it, and you can appreciate behavioural science and Gigerenzer without suffering from two conflicting ideas in your mind.
In a recent LSE lecture about his new book Risk Savvy: How to Make Good Decisions (which sits unread in my reading pile), Gigerenzer again has a few swipes at Daniel Kahneman and friends.</description>

      <description>I am reading John Coates’s thus far excellent The Hour Between Dog and Wolf: How Risk Taking Transforms Us, Body and Mind. There are many highlights and interesting pieces, the below being one of them.
First, we do not see in real-time:
When light hits out retina, the photons must be translated into a chemical signal, and then into an electrical signal that can be carried along nerve fibers. The electrical signal must then travel to the very back of the brain, to an area called the visual cortex, and then project forward again, along two separate pathways, one processing the identity of the objects we see, the “what” stream, as some researchers call it, and the other processing the location and motion of the objects, the “where” stream.</description>

      <description>MIT Technology reports new research on the &amp;ldquo;wisdom of the confident&amp;rdquo;:
It turns out that if a crowd offers a wide range of independent estimates, then it is more likely to be wise. But if members of the crowd are influenced in the same way, for example by each other or by some external factor, then they tend to converge on a biased estimate. In this case, the crowd is likely to be stupid.</description>

      <description>Recently, I&amp;rsquo;ve tended to roll my eyes rather than respond to poor commentary on behaviour genetics. But areview by Kate Douglas at New Scientist, in which she pulls the behaviour genetics to eugenics to Nazi manoeuvre, has pointed out a potentially interesting book.
First, from the conclusion to Douglas&amp;rsquo;s review (actually, not so much a review but a launchpad):
Behaviour geneticists came to see finding high heritability as a justification for their work.</description>

      <description>For those in or near Sydney at the end of July, there&amp;rsquo;s an interesting conference in the works - the Marketing Science Ideas Exchange. From the blurb:
The Marketing Science Ideas Xchange (MSiX) is the first event of its type in Australia dedicated to the interface between behavioural science and marketing. The conference will demonstrate why behavioural sciences in general, and behavioural economics in particular, is making such strong headways into advertising.</description>

The videos for the conference are now up, so as I watch through them, I&amp;rsquo;ll post links and some brief thoughts. The first session, with videos linked below, was on Genes and Socioeconomic Aggregates. The video and audio are average at times, and you might want to get the slides (links provided where available) as they are hard to read in the video at times.</description>

[W]e tend to view financial risk taking as a purely intellectual activity. But this view is incomplete. Risk is more than an intellectual puzzle — it is a profoundly physical experience, and it involves your body. Risk by its very nature threatens to hurt you, so when confronted by it your body and brain, under the influence of the stress response, unite as a single functioning unit. This occurs in athletes and soldiers, and it occurs as well in traders and people investing from home.</description>

 A conversation with Rory Sutherland. Many good pieces, but my favourite line:  Certainly there&#39;s a problem with numbers in that there are sophisticated things in life that we all understand perfectly well when verbally described. Should psychology be constrained by math? I mean, who has the better understanding of human behavior—Shakespeare or Eugene Fama? If you make mathematical expression a barrier to entry, to any kind of theory, you are undoubtedly limiting yourselves.</description>

      <description>First, from Andrew Leigh, discussing Gregory Clark&amp;rsquo;s work showing that low social mobility persists across countries and policy environments:
How do we break the pattern? Part of the answer must lie in a fair tax system, a targeted social welfare system, effective early childhood programs, and getting great teachers in front of disadvantaged classrooms. We need banks willing to take a chance on funding an outsider, and it doesn’t hurt to maintain a healthy Aussie scepticism about inherited privilege.</description>

      <description>Gary Becker was one of the first economists to seriously contemplate the role that evolutionary biology could play in economics. In 1976, he wrote:
I have argued that both economics and sociobiology would gain from combining the analytical techniques of economists with the techniques in population genetics, entomology, and other biological foundations of sociobiology. The preferences taken as given by economists and vaguely attributed to “human nature” or something similar – the emphasis on self-interest, altruism toward kin, social distinction, and other enduring aspects of preferences – may be largely explained by the selection over time of traits having greater genetic fitness and survival value.</description>

      <description>Despite reviews first appearing on the web a couple of months ago, I somehow missed the imminent release of Nicholas Wade&amp;rsquo;s A Troublesome Inheritance: Genes, Race and Human History. In a WSJ review, Charles Murray places Wade&amp;rsquo;s book on a continuum that includes E.O. Wilson&amp;rsquo;s Sociobiology and his own The Bell Curve (written with Richard Herrnstein). Based on the review, I expect A Troublesome Inheritance will draw an equal amount of heat, although it will play out in a world of twitter outrage.</description>

It is a decent summary of the behavioural science literature on political bias, although there are few surprises and not a lot of fresh opinion.
The one piece new to me concerned the moderation of people&amp;rsquo;s views after they are forced to explain their understanding of an issue. The basic story is as follows:</description>

I daresay there are now near five hundred people in Dobbo of various races, all met in this remote corner of the East, as they express it, &#34;to look for their fortune;&#34; to get money any way they can. They are most of them people who have the very worst reputation for honesty as well as every other form of morality,—Chinese, Bugis, Ceramese, and half-caste Javanese, with a sprinkling of half-wild Papuans from Timor, Babber, and other islands, yet all goes on as yet very quietly.</description>

      <description>In my last post, I discussed the framework for cultural evolution laid out by Claire El Mouden and colleagues in a new article in the Journal of Evolutionary Biology (ungated pdf and supporting information). By setting out clear definitions for the analysis of cultural evolution, such as cultural relatedness and fitness, a workable framework using evolutionary biology&amp;rsquo;s Price equation can be developed.
As I noted in that post, it is when the biological and genetic frameworks are laid on top of each other, as is the focus of the dual-inheritance literature, that things get interesting.</description>

      <description>A sojourn into the literature on cultural evolution can be confusing. Authors use the same terms in different ways. Unique models are used to reach opposite conclusions. And each author seems to find their own way to intertwine genetic evolution into the analysis.
In that light, a new article in the Journal of Evolutionary Biology (ungated pdf and supporting information) by Claire El Mouden and friends seeks to nail down some of the concepts of cultural evolution and to set up a general framework (thank you!</description>

      <description>When low-status males have no chance of accessing females via traditional routes such as fighting or signalling their prowess, they may attempt more deceptive means of getting a mate.
As an example, some male fish take advantage of the external fertilisation of eggs by hiding on the periphery of the courting male&amp;rsquo;s territory, including in some cases disguising themselves as females. When the eggs are released, they rush in and attempt to fertilise them.</description>

Math skills and market and non-market outcomes: Evidence from an Amazonian society of forager-farmers.Research in industrial nations suggests that formal math skills are associated with improvements in market and non-market outcomes. But do these associations also hold in a highly autarkic setting with a limited formal labor market? We examined this question using observational annual panel data (2008 and 2009) from 1,121 adults in a native Amazonian society of forager-farmers in Bolivia (Tsimane&#39;).</description>

      <description>From Richard Posner (HT: Ryan Murphy):
[Behavioral economics] is undertheorized because of its residual, and in consequence purely empirical, character. Behavioral economics is defined by its subject rather than by its method and its subject is merely the set of phenomena that the most elementary, stripped down rational-choice models do not explain. It would not be surprising if many of these phenomena turned out to be unrelated to each other, just as the set of things that are not edible by man include stones, toadstools, thunder-claps, and the Pythagorean theorem.</description>

      <description>An interesting idea in Herb Gintis&amp;rsquo;s review of The Origin of Wealth (pdf):
One of the ironies of history is that if the Walrasian model were plausible, there would be no need for real markets, real competition, or even capitalism itself. Socialism, consisting of a bureau of technocrats implementing the Walrasian auctioneer, could harness the general equilibrium system to a system of public ownership of wealth. This aspect of the general equilibrium model was clearly understood by Oskar Lange, F.</description>

      <description>In the academic literature at the intersection of economics and evolutionary biology, evolution of time preference (patience) is one area that has received much attention. This makes some sense, as most economic models that consider decisions over time include time preference. Time preference is normally included in the model through a discount rate of a fixed value, so an evolutionary analysis might help in determining what that value is.
One of the first articles to ask what rate of time preference might be expected to evolve was by Ingemar Hansson and Charles Stuart, who examined the intergenerational rate of time preference.</description>

      <description>It seems obvious that having multiple wives is a good thing for the fitness of a man. Similarly, having the women in a population monopolised by a small number of men is not good for the fitness of those men who miss out on a mate. In such a society, the large difference in fitness between the haves and the have-nots would be expected to result in strong sexual selection.</description>

      <description>In a recent post, I discussed Gianni De Fraja&amp;rsquo;s paper in which he proposed that sexual selection shaped the nature of conspicuous consumption by men. In his model, conspicuous consumption by men serves as a fitness indicator to women. Low and high quality men signal their differing wealth &amp;ldquo;honestly&amp;rdquo; (under certain conditions) as the consumption level of the high quality men is too large a handicap for the low quality men to copy.</description>

      <description>Since Thorstein Veblen&amp;rsquo;s 1899 book Theory of the Leisure Class, the economics profession has taken a somewhat mixed approach to consumption. In areas such signalling theory, Veblen&amp;rsquo;s argument that conspicuous consumption must be wasteful and expensive to be a reliable signal of wealth is well recognised. Conspicuous consumption has a purpose as a signal. However, the typical economic model is built on the simple concept that more consumption brings more utility.</description>

      <description>Humans are inherently risk averse. When offered a coin toss with a reward of $10,000 for heads but a loss of $10,000 for tails, most people would decline. They would likely agree to pay a significant sum to avoid the gamble, despite the expected value of the gamble being zero.
When economists describe the preferences of a person, they often build in some form of risk aversion. A risk averse person will always prefer a sum with certainty than a gamble with that expected value.</description>

      <description>Time preference is a measure of one&amp;rsquo;s future orientation. It has been linked with long-term individual outcomes (as was shown by Mischel&amp;rsquo;s marshmallows) and influences macroeconomic outcomes such as the level of saving and investment.
Time preference is not consistent across countries. This was shown in a working paper by Wang, Rieger and Hens, who examined variation in time preference across 45 countries. They found significant cross-country variation in time preference and further, that it could not be explained by differences in interest rates or inflation.</description>

      <description>Despite the massive influence of Richard Nelson and Sidney Winter&amp;rsquo;s An Evolutionary Theory of Economic Change within evolutionary economic circles, the book and the body of work it inspired has had a limited effect through mainstream economics. I believe there are a few reasons for this, but I&amp;rsquo;ve always thought that this 1996 speech by Paul Krugman to a bunch of evolutionary economists captures one of them:
To read the real thing in evolution - to read, say, John Maynard Smith&#39;s _Evolution and the Theory of Games_, or William Hamilton&#39;s new book of collected papers, _Narrow Roads in Gene Land_, is a startling experience to someone whose previous idea of evolution comes from magazine articles and popular books.</description>

      <description>Richard Nelson and Sidney Winter&amp;rsquo;s An Evolutionary Theory of Economic Change is the book on which modern &amp;ldquo;evolutionary economics&amp;rdquo; is built. Published in 1982, Nelson and Winter took the ideas expressed by Armen Alchian and Joseph Schumpeter decades earlier and presented a direct evolutionary challenge to mainstream approaches to economic growth, technological progress and competition between firms.
Nelson and Winter&amp;rsquo;s conception of firms is a collection of heterogeneous organisations guided by routines, the evolutionary economic equivalent of genes.</description>

      <description>From Boyd and Richerson&amp;rsquo;s The Origin and Evolution of Cultures (references removed):
The proposal that human intelligence is at the root of human cooperation is difficult to evaluate because of the ambiguity in what we might mean by intelligence in a comparative context. As the Tasmanian Effect [the loss of their toolkit in a small population] illustrates, individual human intelligence is only a part, and perhaps only a small part, of being able to create complex adaptive behaviors.</description>

      <description>In the process of listening to audio versions of some of the less arduous books on my reading list, I have just listened to Richard Thaler and Cass Sunstein&amp;rsquo;s Nudge.
The ideas in the book have been discussed in the public realm often enough that the book didn&amp;rsquo;t contain any surprises, although the emphasis in the book is a touch different from that in public debate. That difference in emphasis largely relates to the first word of Thaler and Sunstein&amp;rsquo;s philosophy, &amp;ldquo;libertarian paternalism&amp;rdquo;, and how nudges could be used to increase freedom.</description>

One favour to ask. I completely agree with you that Behavioural Economics should be called Behavioural Science. But  We don’t really to decide what things are called. Darwin only used the word “evolution” a handful of times.
  It is a very valuable term as a Trojan Horse. If I want to get people studying for MBAs, say, or people in finance, to take behavioural science seriously, anything with the word “economics” in it will get their attention: anything with the word “psychology” in it, by contrast, will probably make them think of couches and hypnosis.</description>

      <description>After reading Chris Auld&amp;rsquo;s 18 signs you&amp;rsquo;re reading bad criticism of economics (I agree with most, although by viewing them as &amp;ldquo;signs&amp;rdquo; with exceptions), I was thinking about what signs someone should someone look for in a decent critique. So, here are my thoughts. Some are twists on Auld&amp;rsquo;s points, or could easily be turned into additional reasons that a criticism is likely bad, but they&amp;rsquo;re a useful initial filter.</description>

      <description>As I pointed out in my last post, Jared Diamond called the transition to agriculture the worst mistake in the history of the human race. Yet despite evidence that the early adopters of agriculture were shorter and had worse nutrition and health than the hunter-gatherers that preceded them, the agricultural way of life came to dominate human society. Health may have rebounded as humans adapted to their new lifestyles, and the long-term benefits are now clear, but why would the early adopters of agriculture shift to what would appear to be a much a poorer way of life?</description>

      <description>Relative to their hunter-gatherer counterparts, early Neolithic farmers were short, had poor dental health due to malnutrition, bone lesions suggestive of disease and stunted spines from the back-breaking labour. This comparison underlies Jared Diamond&amp;rsquo;s claim that agriculture was the worst mistake in the history of the human race.
However, this decline in health was not permanent. For example, the health of Egyptians 12,000 years ago, shortly after the shift to farming from foraging, was poor.</description>

(For those not up to speed, Chabris opens, Gladwell responds, Chabris has another go, Gelman comments, twitter goes nuts, and if you google, you&amp;rsquo;ll find plenty of other contributions).
First, I am not a fan of, for want of a better way of describing it, the conformist strain that underlies some of the critiques.</description>

      <description>Well, one anthropologist anyway. I&amp;rsquo;m normally the first person to admit that economics would benefit from incorporating findings from other fields into its understanding of human behaviour, be that from anthropology, biology, evolutionary psychology or whatever other field might yield useful insight. After all, that is one of my focuses for this blog. But sometimes the caricatures of economics become too much to bear. So for this post, I want to take a moment to defend economics.</description>

It is not a &amp;ldquo;how to&amp;rdquo; book, although there are plenty of principles (and suggestions to be humble) worth following.

      <description>I rate Dan Ariely&amp;rsquo;s The Upside of Irrationality: The Unexpected Benefits of Defying Logic lower than Predictably Irrational. Like Predictably Irrational, The Upside of Irrationality is based largely on Ariely&amp;rsquo;s own work (a good thing). But where Ariely had 15 years of experiments to call on for his first book, for this one he seems limited to a couple of years of newer experiments and the experiments in the reject pile from the first.</description>

      <description>I am called an evolutionary economist often enough that I have been tempted to write a post titled &amp;ldquo;Why I am not an evolutionary economist&amp;rdquo;. In the absence of that post, Peter Turchin quizzed Ulrich Witt on what evolutionary economics is, and provides a useful description:
[T]here are two main currents in evolutionary economics, which have developed largely independently of each other. One research direction, within which Ulrich himself has been working, begins by questioning the assumption of homo economicus, a rational agent that choses those actions that yield the best balance of rewards versus costs.</description>

She [Ostrom] persevered and secured her PhD after studying the management of fresh water in Los Angeles. In the first half of the 20th century, the city’s water supply had been blighted by competing demands to pump fresh water for drinking and farming. By the 1940s, however, the conflicting parties had begun to resolve their differences.</description>

      <description>From Smithsonian magazine (HT: John Hawks):
Though northern muriquis are critically endangered, the population in Strier’s study site, which is protected from further deforestation and hunting, has increased. There are now 335 individuals in four groups, a sixfold increase since Strier started her study.That’s a development worth celebrating, but it’s not without consequences. The monkeys appear to be outgrowing the reserve and, in response to this population pressure, altering millennia of arboreal behavior.</description>

      <description>In 1798, Thomas Malthus described a world where technological progress did not increase per person income. Any additional income was consumed by population growth. It appeared a solid explanation of the world to that point, but Malthus had the misfortune of describing the &amp;ldquo;Malthusian world&amp;rdquo; just when some parts of that world were breaking their Malthusian shackles. This left Malthus with a somewhat tarnished reputation (I consider undeservedly), with the Malthusian model failing to offer an explanation for why it no longer seemed to apply.</description>

      <description>After sitting in my reading pile for the best part of three years, I have finally read (or more accurately, listened to) Dan Ariely&amp;rsquo;s Predictably Irrational. One of the most commonly referenced popular books on behavioural science, it describes Ariely&amp;rsquo;s experiments in the areas of cheating, procrastination, social norms, hot decision-making and so on.
One nice element of the book is that Ariely describes his own experiments. In the behavioural science literature, you often come across the same experiments over and over.</description>

      <description>Although most of my interest in integrating evolutionary biology into economics concerns treating people as evolved (or evolving) animals, economists can also learn a lot from the dynamic analysis of biological systems. This thought is shared by John Gowdy and colleagues and is the subject of their third economic cosmology, equilibrium, in their article Economic cosmology and the evolutionary challenge from the Journal of Economic Behavior &amp;amp; Organization special issue, _Evolution as a General Theoretical Framework for Economics and Public Policy.</description>

      <description>Adam Smith&amp;rsquo;s concept of the invisible hand is one of the more abused ideas in economics. Mentioned only once in The Wealth of Nations, and only then in the context of preferring domestic to foreign industry, the invisible hand has come to represent the idea that self-interest can improve the common good. The following phrase from The Wealth of Nations nicely captures the idea of the invisible hand (although it is not located with Smith&amp;rsquo;s use of the term):</description>

      <description>The social sciences have recently become a common battleground for debates about group selection. From Jonathan Haidt&amp;rsquo;s use of group selection to explain &amp;ldquo;groupish&amp;rdquo; traits in humans, to some of the recent rumblings about cultural group selection (as expressed in a debate triggered by Steven Pinker), and even at last years Consilience Conference, group selection has undergone a revival in the social sciences.
One social science in which group selection has re-emerged is economics, with the most recent occurrence in the Journal of Economic Behavior &amp;amp; Organization special issue, Evolution as a General Theoretical Framework for Economics and Public Policy.</description>

      <description>In the lead article to a recent Journal of Economic Behavior &amp;amp; Organization special issue, Evolution as a General Theoretical Framework for Economics and Public Policy, David Sloan Wilson and John Gowdy examined four reasons why someone may not need to consult an evolutionary framework in examining economic and policy questions. The four arguments are riffs on the same theme, but the distinctions between them are worth making.
The first reason is that smart people will come to similar conclusions even if they use different approaches.</description>

      <description>My assessment of An Economic Theory of Greed, Love, Groups, and Networks by Paul Frijters with Gigi Foster varies with the objective I assess it against. On the one hand, Frijters and Foster seek to supplement what they call the &amp;ldquo;mainstream economic&amp;rdquo; view to give an enhanced perspective of how society works. Although they sometimes talk this objective down, it is inherently ambitious and encompasses a significant expansion of core economic theory.</description>

      <description>In my last post, I noted one of the major themes of a new Journal of Economic Literature paper, How Deep Are the Roots of Economic Development (ungated pdf). Enrico Spolaore and Romain Wacziarg reviewed some literature that makes a strong case that it is population, not institutions, that underlies long-term economic growth. This post turns to the focus of the second half of the article - the genetic and cultural intergenerational transmission of development.</description>

      <description>I first flagged this article a year or so ago when it was released as a working paper, but the new Journal of Economic Literature paper How Deep Are the Roots of Economic Development (ungated pdf) by Enrico Spolaore and Romain Wacziarg has so much good material in it that it is worth a revisit.
I am going to cover the article over two posts. This first post covers the major theme of the first half of the paper - that it is populations, not institutions, that underlie persistent differences in economic development.</description>

  Brandon Keim discusses a new Science paper by Douglas Fry and Patrik Söderberg questioning how warlike human nature is. My two cents: a war to personal violence ratio is a poor way to look at this. If we interpret the ratio in the other direction, we could say that human nature inclines us to high rates of interpersonal violence. I&amp;rsquo;d prefer examination of baseline rates.</description>

      <description>It has been a few months since I wrote most of my series of posts on Quamrul Ashraf and Oded Galor&amp;rsquo;s paper The ‘Out of Africa’ Hypothesis, Human Genetic Diversity, and Comparative Economic Development. This last post in the series is on the implication of their argument for policy.
As a recap, Ashraf and Galor showed a hump-shaped relationship between genetic diversity and economic development across countries and populations. They proposed that two opposing effects of genetic diversity cause this hump-shaped pattern: diversity promoting innovation and productivity through the greater range of traits available in the population, and negative effects through conflict between more dissimilar individuals.</description>

      <description>In his research on social mobility using surnames, Gregory Clark has found lower levels of social mobility than many other studies. Clark has defended this finding on the basis that analysis of social mobility across a single generation or using a single variable will overestimate it. Clark writes:
Conventional estimates of social mobility, which look at just single aspects of social status such as income, are contaminated by noise. If we measure mobility on one aspect of status such as income, it will seem rapid.</description>

      <description>In his seminal paper Population Growth and Technological Change: One Million B.C. to 1990, Michael Kremer combined two basic concepts to explain the greater than exponential population growth in human populations over the last million years.
The first concept is that more people means more ideas. A larger population will generate more ideas to feed technological progress.
The second concept is that, in a Malthusian world, population is constrained by income, with income a function of technology.</description>

      <description>In my last post, I noted R.A. Fisher&amp;rsquo;s argument that a larger population leads to more mutations and greater potential for adaptive evolution. As human populations have undergone massive growth over recent tens of thousands of years, we would expect the evidence of this population growth to show in our genomes. In this post, I point to a couple of papers that look at this evidence.
In the first, Recent acceleration of human adaptive evolution, John Hawks and colleagues examined the age distribution of positively selected gene variants in a 3.</description>

      <description>A core ideas in economics is that more people means more ideas. To take an extreme case, you would expect a population of one person to generate fewer ideas that a population of one million people. The precise relationship between population and ideas depends on factors such as the fishing-out of ideas, network effects, the composition of the population and the like, but it would seem to be strongly positive.</description>

 Malcolm Gladwell on Albert O. Hirschman. One good paragraph:  People don’t seek out challenges, he went on. They are “apt to take on and plunge into new tasks because of the erroneously presumed _absence_ of a challenge—because the task looks easier and more manageable than it will turn out to be.” This was the Hiding Hand principle—a play on Adam Smith’s Invisible Hand. The entrepreneur takes risks but does not see himself as a risk-taker, because he operates under the useful delusion that what he’s attempting is not risky.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m not sure if the format of the Dutch postcode lottery is common, but it certainly creates some interesting incentives. In this lottery, a random postcode is drawn from the 430,000 postcodes in the Netherlands, with each postcode having, on average, 19 households. Each person in that postcode who has purchased a ticket in the lottery receives €12,500 for each ticket that they hold (people can buy more than one ticket), and one ticket in the postcode is awarded a BMW.</description>

It has a lot of interesting content. It talks about how height peaked in Europe around 800 AD, before declining through to 1700 (largely associated with the rise of cities), and then commencing an upward climb. It notes how Mexican-American teenagers have now equalled the United States norm, while American Mayan teenagers have gained four inches on Guatemalan Mayan teenagers in around two decades.</description>

      <description>In a discussion on the rise of mental health issues at Core Economics, Paul Frijters touches on the increase in obesity over the last 50 years.
One can basically out of hand reject the excuses most individuals give for their problems as being the reason. The rate of increase rules out any reasonable role for genetics. The fact that the poor suffer more from obesity, whilst it is cheaper to eat less and whilst food has always been cheap for the rich, rules out any obvious effect of the lower price of food or the availability of fast-food.</description>

      <description>For some time, the &amp;ldquo;Paleo&amp;rdquo; lifestyle has been due for a decent critique from the perspective of growing evidence about the rapid rate of human evolution. Humans have evolved markedly since the dawn of agriculture, with adaptations ranging from disease resistance to the improved ability to digest starch. So when I heard of Marlene Zuk&amp;rsquo;s Paleofantasy: What Evolution Really Tells Us about Sex, Diet, and How We Live, I was looking forward to that critique being provided.</description>

We argue that a model may qualify as theory only if it purports to answer three questions: Theory of what?, Why should we care?, What merit in your explanation? We examine the 66 regular articles appearing in the 2004 issues of Journal of Economic Theory—“the leading journal in economic theory” —and apply the three requirements.</description>

He&amp;rsquo;s been pushing the multilevel selection wheelbarrow with not much support for close to forty years (although support seems to be growing in some circles). And over the last couple of years, he&amp;rsquo;s been increasingly promoting the idea of a evolution-centred &amp;ldquo;science of intentional change&amp;rdquo; that will allow us to change our behavioural and cultural practices. And as a simple step on the way there, all we have to do is conceptually unify the behavioural sciences.</description>

      <description>From Neil Niman&amp;rsquo;s article Sexual Selection and Economic Positioning:
If economic agents earn the market clearing wage or the normal rate of return, it becomes difficult for an individual to stand out relative to one’s peers. Yet it is the ability to distinguish one’s prosperity and prospects that lead to reproductive success—a level of success that ultimately determines which genes are passed along from generation to generation. Thus, if the economic agent is to maximize the probability for survival of the gene through time, it cannot be a passive ‘price taker,’ but rather must be an active seeker of relative success.</description>

      <description>For lack of time to write a post laying out my complete thoughts on Jason Richwine&amp;rsquo;s thesis on IQ and immigration (it&amp;rsquo;s the sort of topic where if you want to engage, you need to engage fully) and doubt whether I have anything new to add, I&amp;rsquo;ve been waiting for a media piece that would allow me to say &amp;ldquo;that&amp;rsquo;s roughly my position&amp;rdquo;. So far, one hasn&amp;rsquo;t appeared, but perhaps the closest article is this post by Andrew Sullivan of The Dish.</description>

      <description>There has been plenty of noise about the Heritage Foundation&amp;rsquo;s report on immigration reform, with most of that noise centered around the PhD thesis of one of the report&amp;rsquo;s co-authors, Jason Richwine (part 1 and part 2). In his thesis, Richwine proposed an IQ filter on immigration (dressed up as a skills test) to avoid the potential social and economic consequences of admitting immigrants with persistently low IQ.
The debate (or to be more accurate, the lack thereof) triggered a couple of tangential thoughts.</description>

From Jennifer Schuessler in the NYT:
Most game theory, he noted, treats players as equally “rational” parties sitting across a chessboard. But many situations, Mr. Chwe points out, involve parties with unequal levels of strategic thinking.</description>

      <description>Imagine two populations of asexually reproducing people (asexual reproduction is where each child comes from a single parent, not a couple). In the first population, each person has a 50 per cent chance of having no children, and a 50 per cent chance of having two children. If there is no relationship between the outcomes for each person (i.e. they face idiosyncratic risk) and the population is large, we would expect the population to remain relatively constant over time.</description>

      <description>Carl Zimmer writes about a new paper in Trends in Genetics where the authors argue that natural selection during pregnancy is an important driver of recent evolutionary changes:
Women nourish their fetuses by raising the level of sugar in their blood. That’s a dangerous game, because it threatens to throw off their own delicate balance between sugar and insulin. If that balance gets out of whack, women may suffer gestational diabetes.</description>

      <description>A couple of months ago I linked to a piece by Ronald Coase about the state of economics. Coase wrote:
Economics as currently presented in textbooks and taught in the classroom does not have much to do with business management, and still less with entrepreneurship. The degree to which economics is isolated from the ordinary business of life is extraordinary and unfortunate.As readers of this blog would know, most of what I read and write is relatively isolated from ordinary business life.</description>

In short, if an altruist cares about other people&amp;rsquo;s welfare in addition to their own and is willing to transfer their resources to others, an egoist&amp;rsquo;s action to harm the altruist may also harm the egoist as the amount that the altruist would be willing to transfer to the egoist will be reduced.</description>

If you want a single, unified theory of economic behavior we already have the best one available, the selfish, rational agent model.</description>

      <description>Since the time of Darwin, the same evolutionary psychology debates have played out over and over. Here is Ronald A. Fisher in The Genetical Theory of Natural Selection (1930), addressing the type of argument that you can still hear today about the evolution of the human mind:
[I]t is often felt to be derogatory to human nature, and especially to such attributes as man most highly values — as if I had said that the human brain was not more important than the trunk of an elephant, or as if I had said that it ought not to be more important to us, if only we were as rational as we should be.</description>

      <description>When we experience positive events, we feel happy. But happiness adjusts, with the effects of a positive event normally short-lived. Over the long-term, happiness tends to float around a stable mean. Happiness is also strongly related to our position relative to our peers. How happy we are with our income depends on everyone else&amp;rsquo;s income.
In line with the first law of behavioural genetics, it is worth looking for an evolutionary foundation to this pattern.</description>

      <description>Underlying much of Ashraf and Galor&amp;rsquo;s analysis of genetic diversity and economic development is a Malthusian model of the world. The Malthusian model, as the name suggests, originates in the work of Thomas Malthus (pictured). Malthus had the misfortune of providing an excellent description of the world across millennia, just at the point at which the model (apparently) lost much of its predictive power.
The Malthusian model rests on the assumption that any increase in income generates population growth.</description>

[F]rom the earliest times of which we have knowledge, the hereditary proclivities, which undoubtedly form the basis of man&#39;s fitness for social life, are found to be supplemented by an economic system, which, diverse as are the opinions which different writers have formed about it, appears to the writer to be one of the unconscious triumphs of early human organization.</description>

Adaptability is the power to detect and respond to change in the world, no matter how surprising or inconvenient it may be.While there&amp;rsquo;s much chatter in the management world about the need to be adaptable, only a few creative companies and innovative managers have probed the natural world for its adaptability secrets.</description>

      <description>In a paper in Economic Letters (ungated version here), Ying Bai and James Kung test Spolaore and Wacziarg&amp;rsquo;s hypothesis on genetic distant and economic development:
Since 1949, trade and economic ties as well as the physical movement of people between Taiwan and the Chinese mainland had been banned. Given this disconnection, one would naturally expect the relative genetic distance – operating presumably via the diffusion of technology or institution – from Taiwan to have no effect on the income differences among provinces in the Chinese mainland.</description>

      <description>Over the last year I have seen several blog posts and articles discussing the merits of being an academic blogger, most recently this piece by Patrick Dunleavy and Chris Gilson (HT: John Hawks). Having been blogging on my research interest - the intersection of economics and evolutionary biology - for around two years now, I thought I would offer an interim assessment.
I am a PhD student at the University of Western Australia, studying an area that no-one in Australia (as far as I am aware) specialises in.</description>

      <description>In two recent posts I examined the causative mechanisms underlying Ashraf and Galor&amp;rsquo;s hypothesis linking genetic diversity to economic growth (innovation and conflict). In those posts, I avoided examining whether genetic diversity could be considered a proxy of phenotypic diversity unrelated to that genetic diversity (such as language).
Part of the reason for this is that Ashraf and Galor do not indicate in their paper or web appendix that they intended to use genetic diversity as a proxy in this way.</description>

      <description>Being a naturalist in the Victorian era was a different exercise to today. From Darwin&amp;rsquo;s The Descent of Man:
Many kinds of monkeys have a strong taste for tea, coffee, and spiritous liquors: they will also, as I have myself seen, smoke tobacco with pleasure. (6. The same tastes are common to some animals much lower in the scale. Mr. A. Nichols informs me that he kept in Queensland, in Australia, three individuals of the Phaseolarctus cinereus [koalas]; and that, without having been taught in any way, they acquired a strong taste for rum, and for smoking tobacco.</description>

      <description>Should Ashraf and Galor&amp;rsquo;s paper The ‘Out of Africa’ Hypothesis, Human Genetic Diversity, and Comparative Economic Development have been published?
The major critique about whether the paper should have been published comes from the conclusion of anarticle in Current Anthropology:
 Social scientists seeking to explain economic behavior through genetics must exercise particular caution. As Benjamin et al. (2012:656) point out, “researchers in this field hold a special responsibility to try to accurately inform the media and the public about the limitations of the science,” especially in studies intended for “social-scientific interventions” (Benjamin 2010:1).</description>

      <description>Ashraf and Galor&amp;rsquo;s hypothesis linking genetic diversity to economic growth has two limbs. The first, which I posted about last week, is that genetic diversity pushes out the production possibility frontier through increasing the range of traits in the population for developing and implementing new technologies. The second, the subject of today&amp;rsquo;s post, is that genetic diversity decreases trust and cooperation between people, increasing social disorder and conflict.
The measure of genetic diversity used by Ashraf and Galor is expected heterozygosity, which is a measure of the probability that two people selected from the population will have the same allele (variety of a gene), averaged across all measured genes.</description>

      <description>The Economist reports on Greg Clark&amp;rsquo;s work using surnames to track social mobility. I have posted about this work before, but The Economist piece makes an important point. When tracking mobility across generations, you cannot simply extrapolate the results of a single generation into the future.
Corak’s work draws on recent studies that compare income levels between just two generations: fathers and sons. That is out of necessity; good data covering three or more generations are scarce.</description>

  Paleofantasy: What Evolution Really Tells Us about Sex, Diet, and How We Live by Marlene Zuk. (HT: Evolvify)
  Ignorance, the Ultimate Asset has some good bits. Some interesting lines: Taleb, however, is so consumed with the downsides of a complex world and advises strategies so “hyperconservative,” that he often ends up preaching futility and paralysis. The Santa Fe Institute, likewise, has for years looked to complexity as the next economic paradigm but has mostly emphasized the chaotic nature of the economy and has thus run into explanatory dead ends.</description>

The model is by Oded Galor and Omer Moav model in their article Natural Selection and the Origin of Economic Growth.</description>

Studies show that fertility is substantially heritable; genes partly influence how many children one has. Children of parents who have many children also have many children; children of parents who have few children also have few children.</description>

      <description>In my latest working paper, co-authored with Oliver Richards, we argue that recent fertility increases in developed countries may only be the beginning. From the abstract:
We propose that the recent rise in the fertility rate in developed countries is the beginning of a broad-based increase in fertility towards above-replacement levels. Environmental shocks that reduced fertility over the past 200 years changed the composition of fertility-related traits in the population and temporarily raised fertility heritability.</description>

Sugden asks us to picture a scenario where you are travelling down a road towards another car. You have two alternatives - move to the left or right. The other car has the same choice. If you pick the same, you pass safely. A game theoretic analysis tells us that there are three Nash equilibria – that is, three sets of strategies that neither driver would have incentive to deviate from (or put yet another way, each driver&amp;rsquo;s strategy is a best response to the other driver’s strategy).</description>

In the paper, Crow opens by discussing the prediction of future evolutionary trends for humans:
Prediction of future evolutionary trends is difficult because man himself plays such a decisive role.</description>

**Evolution, the Human Sciences and Liberty**What?
This Mont Pelerin Society Special Meeting has the objective to link the concept of evolution to freedom, reinforce the debate that opposes classical liberal society and statism using biology and anthropology as theoretical foundations, and to understand cultural evolution of open societies as a mean to escape from the tribal order.</description>

      <description>In my last post, I described Kremer&amp;rsquo;s O-ring theory of economic development. Kremer&amp;rsquo;s insight was that if production in an economy consists of many discrete tasks and failure in any one of those tasks can ruin the final output, small differences in skills can drive large differences in output between firms. This can lead to high levels of inequality as the high-skilled work together and are disproportionately more productive.
In a new paper in the Journal of Economic Behavior and Organization (although kicking around as a working paper for a few years), Garett Jones tweaks Kremer&amp;rsquo;s model to capture the observation that measures of worker skill are a stronger predictor of cross-country economic performance than of within-country differences in income.</description>

But before I post about that paper, I thought I&amp;rsquo;d revisit Michael Kremer&amp;rsquo;s classic 1993 paper on which Jones builds.
The name of the theory comes from the cause of the Challenger space shuttle explosion.</description>

      <description>Despite the common public brawls, a paper presented at the American Economic Association annual meeting by Gordon and Dahl shows high levels of consensus between economists on most economic issues. Based on questions to a 41 economist panel established by the Chicago Booth School of Business, on average only 6 per cent disagree with the &amp;ldquo;consensus&amp;rdquo; answer to a question, with around 25 per cent uncertain. This observation holds for what might be viewed as relatively controversial questions, including the effect of stimulus on jobs (although the phrasing of the questions could be changed to increase dispute - such as asking whether the benefits of the stimulus outweighed the costs.</description>

Lately, though, I&#39;ve found myself talking to and reading a little of the work of sociologists and political scientists, and coming away impressed with how adept they are in quantitative methods, how knowledgeable they are about economics, and how willing they are to challenge economic orthodoxy. .</description>

      <description>Is Poverty in Our Genes? is the title of a new extended critique of Ashraf and Galor&amp;rsquo;s forthcoming American Economic Review paper on genetic diversity and economic development. Published in Current Anthropology, the critique is an extension of an earlier piece by a group of academics (mainly from Harvard) who argue that Ashraf and Galor&amp;rsquo;s work is false and undesirable.
The critique spends some time focusing on the data underlying Ashraf and Galor&amp;rsquo;s work, which provides a good reminder of the complexity of human migratory history.</description>

A narrow focus is characteristic of scientific method but gets in the way of understanding social phenomena. ...The economists who argue that the rationale of the family is found in cost savings have a point. Two together can live more cheaply than two separately, if not as cheaply as one. But anyone who thinks the quest for scale economies is the primary explanation of the human desire for family life is strangely deficient in observational capacity, as well as common sense.</description>

First, on whether migration has a genetic basis:
[T]here is a mutation that pops up frequently in such discussions: a variant of a gene called _DRD4,_ which helps control dopamine, a chemical brain messenger important in learning and reward. Researchers have repeatedly tied the variant, known as _DRD4-7R_ and carried by roughly 20 percent of all humans, to curiosity and restlessness.</description>

Krugman argues that Gould was attractive to readers because he made no attempt to explain the mathematical logic of evolutionary theory. Krugman writes:
Ask a working biologist who is the greatest living evolutionary thinker, and he or she will probably answer John Maynard Smith (with nods to George Williams and William Hamilton).</description>

**The Dog that Didn&#39;t Bark: What Item Non-Response Shows about Cognitive and ****Non-Cognitive Ability **What survey respondents choose not to answer (item non-response) provides a useful task based measure of cognitive ability (e.g., IQ) and non-cognitive ability (e.g., Conscientiousness).

Using the big five personality traits - openness, conscientiousness, extraversion, agreeableness and neuroticism - Jokela found that higher levels of conscientiousness in women and higher levels of openness in both sexes became more strongly related to low fertility as time went on. Effectively, cultural conservatives are now more likely to have higher fertility.</description>

In the most massive study of genetic variation yet, researchers estimated the age of more than one million variants, or changes to our DNA code, found across human populations. The vast majority proved to be quite young. The chronologies tell a story of evolutionary dynamics in recent human history, a period characterized by both narrow reproductive bottlenecks and sudden, enormous population growth.</description>

      <description>In Forbes, Jon Entine discusses the rise of &amp;ldquo;positive eugenics&amp;rdquo;:
Scientists offered what they considered to be a progressive solution: “positive eugenics,” which would encourage society’s healthiest citizens to have more children—the founder of Planned Parenthood, Margaret Sanger, was an eager proponent of eugenics—and more tentatively, “negative eugenics.”The “negative” wing of eugenics prevailed, however, which for the most part meant restricting the mentally ill, poor, immigrants and non-whites from propagating. It served as an inspiration and justification for Nazism and the “Final Solution,” which led to the discrediting of the entire movement.</description>

Genetic diversity is, in general, a good thing for a population, for a simple reason: adaptation via natural selection depends on the existence of variation (there cannot be selection in the absence of alternatives). Other things being equal, a population possessing a greater amount of genetic diversity has a greater probability of already possessing adaptive alleles that might be necessary to meet new environmental challenges (e.</description>

      <description>From Matt Ridley in the Wall Street Journal:
Back in the hunter-gatherer Paleolithic, inequality had reproductive consequences. The successful hunter, providing valuable protein for females, got a lot more mating opportunities than the unsuccessful. So it&#39;s possible that men still walk around with a relatively simple equation in their brains, namely that relative success at obtaining assets results in more sexual adventures and more grandchildren.If so, this might explain why it is relative, rather than absolute, inequality that matters so much to people today.</description>

Crabtree&amp;rsquo;s argument has two components. The first is that intelligence is fragile and vulnerable to genetic load (not that he uses the term genetic load). He estimates that within the last three thousand years, the average person would have accumulated at least two mutations that have harmed our intelligence.</description>

      <description>Last week, I presented my paper on conspicuous consumption and economic growth at the annual PhD Conference in Economics and Business. The basic argument of the paper is that the evolution of the propensity to engage in conspicuous consumption is a factor underlying modern economic growth, as conspicuous consumption requires productive activity to produce the resources to consume.
One of the great features of the conference is that each presenter is allocated a discussant who reviews the paper and presents a critique - and the task is taken seriously.</description>

In a nationally representative twin sample, we first show that ∼33% of the variation in life satisfaction is explained by genetic variation. Although previous studies have shown that baseline happiness is significantly heritable, little research has considered molecular genetic associations with subjective well-being.</description>

The book comprises 20 papers (published between 1987 and 2003) that are grouped into five thematic groups: the evolution of social learning; ethnic groups and markers; human cooperation, reciprocity and group selection; archaeology and culture history; and links to other disciplines.</description>

One interesting section included Becker&amp;rsquo;s thoughts on why people demand their own children, as opposed to being satisfied with the children of others.
[T]he demand for _own_ children, the distinguishing characteristic of families, need not be postulated but can be derived.Women producing children can use their own milk as food and can more readily take care of young children while pregnant than while working in the marketplace.</description>

The basic method used in these studies is to examine the share of rare surnames in high or low status occupations and compare it to the overall prevalence of that surname in the population. By tracking the relative status of the rare surname through time (effectively treating those with the same surname as a large family), the change in status through the generations can be measured.</description>

It is a curious scientific fact (explained in evolutionary biology by the Trivers-Willard hypothesis — _Willard_, notice) that high-status animals tend to have more male offspring than female offspring, which holds true across many species, from red deer to mink to _Homo sap_.</description>

There is plenty of commentary about their contribution in the media and blogosphere, so I&amp;rsquo;ll draw attention to just one element of Shapely&amp;rsquo;s work - the 1962 development of the Gale-Shapely algorithm with David Gale, and its application to marriage markets.</description>

      <description>A group of Harvard academics have penned a short response to Ashraf and Galor&amp;rsquo;s forthcoming American Economic Review paper, The Out of Africa Hypothesis, Human Genetic Diversity and Comparative Economic Development.
Ashraf and Galor argue that economic development is affected by genetic diversity, which increases innovation but also increases conflict and distrust. This leads to an optimum &amp;ldquo;goldilocks&amp;rdquo; level of diversity, with genetically diverse Africans and less genetically diverse native Americans falling on either side of that optimum.</description>

      <description>I recently came across a review of Robert Frank&amp;rsquo;s The Darwin Economy by Ted Bergstrom. Frank&amp;rsquo;s argument is largely based on the concept that a person is made worse off when they respond to someone else&amp;rsquo;s consumption choices, as it often turns into a winner takes all arms race. Bergstrom makes an important point that people may wish for someone else to increase their level of conspicuous consumption or competitive output.</description>

      <description>While I find the occasional Ayn Rand (or Ayn Rand fan) bashing amusing, critics of Rand typically mis-characterise her writings (as many of her ardent fans also do). A Slate article by Eric Michael Johnson continues this tradition, where Johnson sets Rand up as the representative of selfish individualists against the altruists of hunter-gather tribes.
Johnson&amp;rsquo;s altruistic case study is the Mbuti hunters of the Congo:
The Mbuti employed long nets of twined liana bark to catch their prey, sometimes stretching the nets for 300 feet.</description>

      <description>From a recent letter in Nature by Rand, Greene and Nowak:
We find that across a range of experimental designs, subjects who reach their decisions more quickly are more cooperative. Furthermore, forcing subjects to decide quickly increases contributions, whereas instructing them to reflect and forcing them to decide slowly decreases contributions. Finally, an induction that primes subjects to trust their intuitions increases contributions compared with an induction that promotes greater reflection.</description>

      <description>The Economist notes a new working paper (pdf) by Bloom and colleagues of the Harvard School of Public Health, which shows that a short-term implication of reduced fertility in poor countries may be increased inequality. As fertility declines initially among the richer residents of the country, they are the first to reap the demographic dividend. From The Economist:
The three countries in the Harvard study which saw the largest declines in child dependency were Côte d’Ivoire (with a GDP per head in 2011 of $1,800), Namibia ($6,800) and Peru ($10,300).</description>

      <description>Having given my thoughts on Haidt&amp;rsquo;s generally excellent The Righteous Mind in my last post, I want to turn to Haidt&amp;rsquo;s use of group selection in the last third of his book. The central themes of his book don&amp;rsquo;t rest on group selection (in my opinion), but Haidt is at the centre of the reemergence of group selection in the social sciences and his points are worth discussing.
Haidt uses the more modern phrase &amp;ldquo;multilevel selection&amp;rdquo; in addition to &amp;ldquo;group selection&amp;rdquo; through the book.</description>

      <description>I am going to give my thoughts on Jonathan Haidt&amp;rsquo;s The Righteous Mind: Why Good People Are Divided by Politics and Religion over two posts as I want to split the good from the bad (second post here). The first two-thirds and the conclusion of the book are excellent. However, slotted in the last third is Haidt&amp;rsquo;s take on group selection. His group selection argument deserves attention, but I don&amp;rsquo;t want to derail this post with a group selection critique, particularly when Haidt&amp;rsquo;s broader arguments do not rest on it.</description>

      <description>One common explanation for fertility declines over the last 200 years is that parents have shifted to investing in quality of children, rather than quantity. What is often not made clear is that this quality-quantity trade-off has two dimensions. The first trade-off relates to socioeconomic status (SES), with greater numbers of children resulting in less investment in education and resource dilution. The second trade-off relates to fitness, as a short-term increase in children may reduce fertility in future generations.</description>

 “Social Networks and Cooperation in Hunter-Gatherers” by Coren Apicella. Presentations such as this always remind me that I should be reading far more work by anthropologists.</description>

      <description>Technology wants increasing efficiency, opportunity, emergence, complexity, diversity, specialisation, ubiquity, freedom, mutualism, beauty, sentience, structure and evolvability. As Kevin Kelly argues in What Technology Wants, these are the same things that life wants. Technology extends evolution&amp;rsquo;s four billion year path.
Whether you buy Kelly&amp;rsquo;s central thesis or not (in general, I don&amp;rsquo;t) and if you ignore some of Kelly&amp;rsquo;s near-religious fervour (particularly in the opening and closing chapters), Kelly provides a strong argument that the growth in technology is primarily beneficial, with the major benefit being increased choice.</description>

      <description>Over the last few months, I have heard the phrase “agriculture creates excess population” or other words to that effect from several sources. The latest is at Evolvify, where Andrew references Richard Manning and writes:
Agriculture creates excess population. The argument that we need more agriculture to support higher population fails to recognize its inherently circular nature.While I have some sympathy to the argument about the destructiveness of agriculture for the ecosystems it supplants, I would prefer to frame the argument differently.</description>

      <description>The Edge has put up video and transcript of a great interview with Joe Henrich (the Canada Research Chair in Culture, Cognition and Evolution at UBC). The whole interview is worth watching or reading.
A couple of the more interesting snippets are below. First, on the division of labour:
One of the interesting things about the division of labor is that you&#39;re not going to specialize in a particular trade—maybe you make steel plows—unless you know that there are other people who are specializing in other kinds of trades which you need—say food or say materials for making housing, and you have to be confident that you can trade with them or exchange with them and get the other things you need.</description>

In our brief conversation, Rose mentioned that he had laid out much of his thinking on the topic in 55 Theses, where Rose describes how to use the insights of evolutionary biology to improve your health.
Reading through the archives of the Social Evolution Forum over the weekend (worth adding to your feed), I came across a post by Peter Turchin recounting a conversation he had with Rose at the same conference.</description>

It was an interesting conference, but as most of the presentations concerned papers that are not yet in the public domain, I won&amp;rsquo;t go into any detail on the particulars (for the moment). However, a few observations are worth making. They may not be news to someone ensconced in the world of experimental economics, but they were news to me.</description>

Flynn makes some interesting points throughout the discussion, including the following thoughts on the interaction between the economy and IQ:
One of the big surprises is that Scandinavia, the IQ gains tailed off towards the end of the last century and many of us thought and I had an open mind that that would mean that they would tail off in the rest of the developed world.</description>

      <description>In an interesting paper in the Journal of Consumer Research, Nailya Ordabayeva and Pierre Chandon propose that conspicuous consumption may be higher in a more equal society as it provides an opportunity for a larger increase in relative rank.
The benefits of conspicuous consumption are highest when everyone is similar as a small signal can allow someone to jump ahead of the greater number of people clustered in similar income groups.</description>

Pontzer and his colleagues&#39; research showed that the number of calories burned in a typical day by a member of the Hadza, a hunter-gatherer tribe in Tanzania, was indistinguishable from that burned by a typical adult from Europe or the United States.</description>

      <description>Paul Frijters has written an interesting review of Daniel Kahneman&amp;rsquo;s Thinking Fast and Slow over at Club Troppo. In the review, Frijters suggests that Kahneman&amp;rsquo;s main contribution to economics is keeping economists honest:
In terms of the whole rationality debate, the main contribution that Kahneman makes with this book, and that he in my opinion has made throughout his career, is to keep economists honest. ...Kahneman’s value derives from the great temptation amongst economists, particularly those of a strong theoretical bent, to fall in love with their abstractions and to pretend they are accurate descriptions of how things really work.</description>

      <description>Peter Turchin, advocate of Cliodynamics, has posted on his recent success in adopting the &amp;ldquo;paleo diet&amp;rdquo;. The diet is based on the food presumably eaten by our evolutionary ancestors in the Paleolithic era, which is before the dawn of agriculture. Lots of meat, fruit, vegetables and nuts, but no grains.
Although I have much sympathy for the paleo diet for its health benefits (its largely how I eat), I&amp;rsquo;ve always thought the paleo label was not quite right.</description>

      <description>From a working paper by Garett Jones released earlier this year:
Social science research has shown that intelligence is positively correlated with patience and frugality, while growth theory predicts that more patient countries will save more. This implies that if nations differ in national average IQ, countries with higher average cognitive skills will tend to hold a greater share of the world’s tradable assets. I provide empirical evidence that in today’s world, countries whose residents currently have the highest average IQs have higher savings rates, higher ratios of net foreign assets to GDP, and higher ratios of U.</description>

      <description>As noted by Steve Hsu and Razib Khan, a new paper in Nature Genetics reports evidence of recent selection on existing variation in height in European populations. The paper&amp;rsquo;s authors summarise as follows:
In summary, we have provided an empirical example of widespread weak selection on standing variation. We observed genetic differences using multiple populations from across Europe, thereby showing that the adult height differences across populations of European descent are not due entirely to environmental differences but rather are, at least partly, genetic differences arising from selection.</description>

      <description>From Mark Pagel, author of Wired for Culture: Origins of the Human Social Mind, in a RSA podcast:
Cultural evolution and genetic evolution are still going on. We&#39;re still evolving. Our societies are strongly selecting against violence and antisocial behaviour at a genetic level. People who knock you over the head and steal your wallet get thrown in jail, and it&#39;s hard to have reproductive success in jail. And some societies even kill people who do those things, and so we are still selecting against antisocial behaviour very strongly in our societies.</description>

      <description>A new paper in PNAS suggests that the similarity between European and Neanderthal genomes is due to population structure in Africa (500,000 odd years ago), not recent interbreeding (50,000 odd years ago). It has been getting a decent bashing, much of it before it was even released. The problem is that the model underlying the theory does not match recent data, which has overtaken the model since the idea behind it was first conceived.</description>

Using 1939 prices, Stigler found that an annual diet consisting of 370 pounds of wheat flour, 57 cans of evaporated milk, 111 pounds of cabbage, 23 pounds of spinach and 285 pounds of navy beans would meet the requirements.</description>

In their analysis of long-term social trends, advocates of cliodynamics focus on four main variables: population numbers, social structure, state strength and political instability.</description>

      <description>Comments on my research often approach the edge of debates about race and IQ, so despite my general lack of interest in going there, I keep a rough watch on what is happening in the area. A couple of weeks ago, Ron Unz made a solid entry into the debate by ploughing through a mountain of data on race, income and IQ to come to the following conclusion:
The central thesis of Lynn and Vanhanen’s work might be called the “Strong IQ Hypothesis,” namely that IQ accurately reflects intelligence, that IQ is overwhelmingly determined by genetics, and that IQ is subject to little or no significant cultural or economic influence after we adjust for the universal Flynn Effect.</description>

One reason for my question was that species are typically defined due to their reproductive isolation, preventing gene transfer between species. In contrast, the unit of selection for firms, business plan modules (the name used by Eric Beinhocker), can spread freely spread between firms.</description>

      <description>After sitting on my reading list for a few years, I have finally read Paul Ormerod&amp;rsquo;s Why Most Things Fail. Ormerod&amp;rsquo;s basic argument is that failure is all around us and given the complexity of the world, there are limits to how much corporations can control their fate or governments can control the success of their policies. Governments, firms and households lack complete information. They do not have the cognitive power to process the available information to determine the optimal choice.</description>

      <description>From a new paper in PLOS Genetics:
[R]efined analyses of modern human genomic data have changed our view of evolutionary forces acting on our genome. While most people assumed that the out-of-Africa expansion had been characterized by a series of adaptations to new environments leading to recurrent selective sweeps, our genome actually contains little trace of recent complete sweeps and the genetic differentiation of human population has been very progressive over time, probably without major adaptive episodesJohn Hawks draws a different conclusion:</description>

      <description>In outing Irving Fisher as a Social Darwinist, Bryan Caplan writes on how Fisher reconciled eugenics and economics. First, Caplan quotes Fisher:
The core of the problem of immigration is, however, one of race and eugenics. If we could leave out of account the question of race and eugenics I should, as an economist, be inclined to the view that unrestricted immigration, although injurious to some classes, is economically advantageous to a country as a whole, and still more to the world as a whole.</description>

      <description>In my last post on group selection, I described how multilevel selection differed from more traditional (and popular) concepts of group selection. One difference is that the multilevel selection framework defines groups as any subset of interacting individuals, such as a cooperating pair or family unit, rather than restricting the definition to population size groups.
There are few tangible examples available on how a multilevel selection framework works, so below is an attempt to offer an illustration of how the definition of group in a multilevel selection framework is used.</description>

      <description>Herbert Simon&amp;rsquo;s autobiography is probably not the best introduction to his work (I would suggest other starting points), but below are two paragraphs that caught my eye.
First, describing Chapter 15 of Models of Man:
Bracketing _satisficing_ with _Darwinian_ may appear contradictory, for evolutionists sometimes talk about survival of the _fittest_. But in fact, natural selection only predicts that survivors will be _fit enough_, that is, fitter than their losing competitors; it postulates satisficing, not optimizing.</description>

      <description>The arguments in the group selection debate at The Edge, as kicked off by Steven Pinker, contain some useful descriptions on what is meant by multilevel selection in a modern sense and how this varies from older formulations of group selection. Some of this is worth drawing out.
The old story of group selection might run as follows. There are two types of people - altruists and egoists. Altruists are willing to incur individual costs for the benefit of the group, while egoists shirk this responsibility for their own benefit.</description>

      <description>Steven Pinker&amp;rsquo;s essay on group selection (my initial post on it here) has now attracted a raft of interesting responses that are well worth reading. While it is hard to stitch together and reconcile the various arguments, in sum they confirm one part of Pinker&amp;rsquo;s argument. In his essay, Pinker wrote:
The first big problem with group selection is that the term itself sows so much confusion. People invoke it to refer to many distinct phenomena, so casual users may literally not know what they are talking about.</description>

Analyzing identical and fraternal twins matched with data on their savings propensities, we find that genetic variation explains about 33 percent of the variation in savings behavior across individuals. Parenting effects on savings behavior are strong for those in their twenties but decay to zero by middle age, i.</description>

      <description>At the end of Moav and Neeman&amp;rsquo;s paper on conspicuous consumption and poverty traps, about which I posted yesterday, the authors suggest an experiment:
It is well known that the rich spend a lot more on charitable contributions than the poor. There are at least three different explanations for this behaviour: charitable contribution is a luxury good, there is stronger social pressure on the rich to contribute more to society and our suggestion that charitable contributions provide a signal about unobserved income (&#39;success&#39;).</description>

      <description>Poverty is no barrier to conspicuous consumption. As Banerjee and Duflo wrote in Poor Economics:
One hidden assumption in our description of the poverty trap is that the poor eat as much as they can. ...Yet, this is not what we see. Most people living with less than 99 cents a day do not seem to act as if they are starving. If they were, surely they would put every available penny into buying more calories.</description>

But forty years later that goal had become hopeless. ...I think it has happened in physics and mathematics, for example.</description>

      <description>Sarah Hill has posted at Scientific American on a new paper (pdf) that she (and colleagues) has written on the lipstick effect. The lipstick effect is a phenomena where sales of beauty products increase in times of recession, in contrast to the reduction in purchases for most other goods. The authors suggest that this reflects the desire of women to reproduce more quickly, and competition between women for access to the relatively scarcer resource-rich men.</description>

      <description>An article by Bentley and colleagues published in PNAS last month points to some very early evidence of persistent inequality. The study headline is the uncovering of the earliest (statistically significant) evidence of status and wealth differences among the first farmers of Neolithic Europe and the existence of a patrilocal kinship system. However, the analysis also suggests that the healthiest farmers when young were also the richest when buried. Early advantage persisted until death.</description>

They note two important papers (which I intend to write more detailed posts about at some stage) by Louis Putterman and David Weil, and by Comin, Easterly and Gong. They write:
[Putterman and Weil] examine explicitly whether it is the historical legacy of geographic locations or the historical legacy of the populations currently inhabiting these locations that matters more for contemporary outcomes.</description>

The first was Pinker&amp;rsquo;s highlighting that when many social scientists talk of group selection, they are talking of cultural group selection.</description>

      <description>A new NBER paper by Bill Easterly and Ross Levine proposes that a large proportion of global development is attributable to European settlement, even where Europeans formed a small minority of the population. The abstract:
A large literature suggests that European settlement outside of Europe shaped institutional, educational, technological, cultural, and economic outcomes. This literature has had a serious gap: no direct measure of colonial European settlement. In this paper, we (1) construct a new database on the European share of the population during the early stages of colonization and (2) examine its impact on the level of economic development today.</description>

He explained that whereas classicists have traditionally been assumed to be the scholars most able to branch into any area of research, today – with advances in evolutionary study – it will be those with scholarship in evolutionary science who will supersede classicists in depth, breadth and usefulness.Dawkins sees his new polymathic course at the New College of the Humanities as part of this trend:</description>

      <description>Project Syndicate has published one of the last pieces by Elinor Ostrom, in which she gives her views on the upcoming Rio+20 summit. The article reflects Ostrom&amp;rsquo;s wariness of blanket, top-down solutions:
Inaction in Rio would be disastrous, but a single international agreement would be a grave mistake. We cannot rely on singular global policies to solve the problem of managing our common resources: the oceans, atmosphere, forests, waterways, and rich diversity of life that combine to create the right conditions for life, including seven billion humans, to thrive.</description>

      <description>Below are three passages that capture a small part of the evolutionary flavour of the now late Elinor Ostrom&amp;rsquo;s work.
From David Sloan Wilson:
Lin’s work was like a breath of fresh air compared to the forbidding world of neoclassical economics, which was top-heavy with theory and required assumptions about human preferences and abilities that were manifestly unrealistic. In contrast, Lin’s work was empirically well grounded and her eight design principles were highly congruent with the evolutionary dynamics of cooperation in all species and the biocultural evolution of our own species.</description>

Frank&amp;rsquo;s major proposal is that the emotions act as a commitment device. When a dispassionate calculation shows that it is better to cheat, the emotion of guilt can act as a constraint to the &amp;ldquo;rational&amp;rdquo; course of action.</description>

We believe that this new approach, centred on the study of complex networks, has enormous potential to integrate, reconcile, and synthesise the social sciences. Viewing society as a complex network requires us to focus on actual human psychology and the nature of human interaction, rather than some inaccurate abstraction (such as “the rational agent”).</description>

It is about this question that all the dispute about &#34;economic planning&#34; centers. This is not a dispute about whether planning is to be done or not. It is a dispute as to whether planning is to be done centrally, by one authority for the whole economic system, or is to be divided among many individuals.After writing my recent post on Richard Conniff&amp;rsquo;s article about Irving Fisher&amp;rsquo;s eugenic leanings, it struck me that a similar framing can be made with respect to eugenics.</description>

      <description>Average human brain size has declined for 20,000 years, a stark contrast to the steady increase over the preceding millions. While I would argue that translation of this reduced brain size into lower intelligence would have a negative result, I am not convinced that intelligence has dropped over that time.
Eighteen months ago, Discover magazine published an article by Kathleen McAuliffe on the shrinking brain phenomenon and what this means for intelligence.</description>

This neither worries nor surprises me. We ceased relying upon individual brain power tens of thousands of years ago. Our civilization now gets all its inventive and creative power from the linking of brains into networks. Our future depends on being clever not individually, but collectively.</description>

We know better now, of course. And yet eugenic ideas still linger just beneath the skin, in what seem to be more innocent forms. We tend to think, for instance, that if we went to Yale, or better yet, went to Yale and married another Yalie, our children will be smart enough to go to Yale, too.</description>

      <description>Last week&amp;rsquo;s edition of Science has an interesting article by Sam Bowles on the role of conflict on human social evolution. Bowles covers some familiar ground on the debate around the role of group selection in shaping human altruistic preferences:
[F]or most animals, gene flow (due to migration) would minimize genetic differences between groups, and hence nullify the genetic effects of group competition. But recent evidence suggests that this may not be the case for a number of species, including recent human foragers, whose population structures may resemble those of our Late Pleistocene ancestors.</description>

Most of the response are worth reading, but I particularly enjoyed the one by Herb Gintis. Some of the more interesting parts of Gintis&amp;rsquo;s piece were as follows:</description>

      <description>When measured against his fantastic The Company of Strangers, Paul Seabright&amp;rsquo;s new book The War of the Sexes: How Conflict and Cooperation Have Shaped Men and Women from Prehistory to the Present was always facing a tough task. The War of the Sexes contains some interesting insights, and it is accessible and easy to read. However, some parts of the book feel flat.
Part of my reaction stems from the first half of the book, titled &amp;ldquo;Prehistory&amp;rdquo;, which contains little new for someone who is well-read in evolutionary biology.</description>

      <description>From Jared Diamond&amp;rsquo;s review of Why Nations Fail:
But it’s obvious that good institutions, and the wealth and power that they spawned, did not crop up randomly. For instance, all Western European countries ended up richer and with better institutions than any tropical African country. Big underlying differences led to this divergence of outcomes. Europe has had a long history (of up to nine thousand years) of agriculture based on the world’s most productive crops and domestic animals, both of which were domesticated in and introduced to Europe from the Fertile Crescent, the crescent-shaped region running from the Persian Gulf through southeastern Turkey to Upper Egypt.</description>

      <description>There is an interesting podcast on Science Talk titled The Coming Entanglement, with Fred Guterl interviewing Bill Joy, co-founder of Sun Microsystems, and Danny Hillis.
The basic argument by Joy and Hillis is that we are reaching a point where our systems are so entangled (most of the conversation is in terms of technical systems) that no one understands the whole thing. They suggest that we need to get over the fact that there is no expert who understands what is going on.</description>

      <description>From an excellent article in Nature News by Ed Yong on problems with replication in psychology:
One reason for the excess in positive results for psychology is an emphasis on “slightly freak-show-ish” results, says Chris Chambers, an experimental psychologist at Cardiff University, UK. “High-impact journals often regard psychology as a sort of parlour-trick area,” he says. Results need to be exciting, eye-catching, even implausible. Simmons says that the blame lies partly in the review process.</description>

One quote in the introduction caught my eye:
[A]cquiring adaptive information from others also opens a portal into people’s brains through which maladaptive ideas can enter—ideas whose content makes them more likely to spread, but do not increase the genetic fitness of their bearers.</description>

      <description>Evidence from twin studies implies that economic and political traits have a significant heritable component. That is, some of the variation between people is attributable to genetic variation.
Despite this, there has been a failure to demonstrate that the heritability can be attributed to specific genes. Candidate gene studies, in which a single gene (or SNP) is examined for its potential influence on a trait, have long failed to identify effects beyond a fraction of one per cent.</description>

      <description>The application of evolutionary biology to politics and policy spans the political spectrum. From Peter Singer&amp;rsquo;s A Darwinian Left to Larry Arnhart&amp;rsquo;s Darwinian Conservatism to Michael Shermer&amp;rsquo;s libertarianism, there is something in evolutionary biology for everyone.
One of the best of of these applications is by Paul Rubin in Darwinian Politics: The Evolutionary Origin of Freedom. While the arguments lead to conclusions that reflect Rubin&amp;rsquo;s political leanings, the book reads as though the evidence shapes the result and Rubin gives the evidence fair consideration.</description>

[T]he outstanding feature of any famous and accomplished person, especially a reputed genius, such as Feynman, is never their level of g (or their IQ), but some special talent and some other traits (e.g., zeal, persistence). Outstanding achievements(s) depend on these other qualities besides high intelligence. The special talents, such as mathematical musical, artistic, literary, or any other of the various “multiple intelligences” that have been mentioned by Howard Gardner and others are more salient in the achievements of geniuses than is their typically high level of g.</description>

      <description>The fundamental insight that utility in economics should be based on the concept of fitness from evolutionary biology lies at the heart of Gandolfi, Gandolfi and Barash&amp;rsquo;s Economics as an Evolutionary Science: From Utility to Fitness.
The first half of the book is fantastic, as the authors describe the economic way of thinking and Gary Becker&amp;rsquo;s seminal work on families, marriage and reproduction. For someone unfamiliar with Becker&amp;rsquo;s work, it is a good introduction to what Becker was setting out to achieve.</description>

      <description>The Consilience Conference on evolution in biology, the social sciences and the humanities wrapped up on Saturday, and it was generally a high quality conference. It&amp;rsquo;s strength was that most of the presenters were doing work across multiple fields, usually with an evolutionary twist. Conferences such as these often involve people trying to frame existing work around the topic, even if it is a weak fit, but here the presenters&#39; work generally fitted the subject nicely.</description>

      <guid>http://localhost:1313/group-selection-and-the-social-sciences/</guid>
      <description>The first day of the Consilience Conference has strengthened my feeling that support for group selection is growing in the social sciences. While the slant of speakers such as Edward O. Wilson and Herb Gintis is no surprise, the degree of support among many conference participants that I have spoken to was. The general argument is that the evolution of &amp;ldquo;altruistic&amp;rdquo; and cooperative behaviour requires group selection.
Again, the question in my mind is at what point do the evolutionary biologist critics of the group selection approach enter into this evolution of cooperation debate that is happening outside of their field?</description>

The evolution by sexual selection of the human propensity to engage in conspicuous consumption contributed to the emergence of modern levels of economic growth.Males who engaged in conspicuous consumption had higher reproductive success than those who did not, as females responded to the costly and honest signal of their underlying characteristics.</description>

**Miller:** Music&#39;s got some key features of an evolved adaptation: It&#39;s universal across cultures, it&#39;s ancient in prehistory, and kids learn it early and spontaneously. ...Marcus: &amp;ldquo;Ancient&amp;rdquo; seems like a bit of stretch to me. The oldest known musical artifacts are some bone flutes that are only 35,000 years old, a blink in an evolutionary time.</description>

      <description>I am sympathetic to the argument by Robert Frank and others that competition for positional goods is a major factor driving our behaviour. The natural outcome of this is that we should want to work more, or at least more than anyone else. However, recent trends in working hours do not neatly fit with this story.
When Jared Diamond proposed that agriculture was the worst mistake in the history of the human race, he was referring primarily to work hours.</description>

      <description>In The Origin of Wealth: Evolution, Complexity, and the Radical Remaking of Economics, Eric Beinhocker argues that the economy should be studied as a complex adaptive system made up of adaptive agents, with the economy emerging from the interactions of those agents. It is an excellent book and possibly the best discussion of why the economy should be studied as a complex adaptive system, but as for other explorations of this area, it does not take the step of bringing complexity economics to life as an applied science.</description>

While my area of interest is sometimes described as &amp;ldquo;evolutionary economics&amp;rdquo;, evolutionary economics is a label generally applied to the study of the interactions of firms, institutions and agents in the economy using an evolutionary methodology. Businesses search the landscape for technology and other sources of competitive advantage, and those business modules (technologies, plans) with higher fitness are replicated and spread.</description>

The Evolutionary Bases of Consumption is Saad&amp;rsquo;s &amp;ldquo;academic book&amp;rdquo;, in which he argues that introducing an evolutionary framework into the analysis of consumer behaviour and marketing theory can provide an explanation for consumption patterns that cultural critiques struggle to provide.</description>

Apart from the many blog posts and column inches, Nature published a response with 137 signatories defending the concept of inclusive fitness. One paragraph by Carl Zimmer captures (for me) where the argument is at:</description>

Nisbett introduced the series [on evolution and social cognition at the University of Michigan] by saying that he once thought every psychology department would need to hire an evolutionary psychologist, but he had changed his mind.

I am torn over whether controlling for education gives us meaningful information.</description>

      <description>Group selection advocates often describe how human cooperation could only have evolved through competition between groups. I have wondered how these advocates view modern day group competition, particularly in the form of tribalism and patriotism. Should we continue to engage in group competition to allow cooperation to flourish?
This article by David Sloan Wilson gives one perspective. Some of the more interesting quotes:
Even small groups can become dysfunctional (i.e., fail to “constitute themselves”) if the analogs of patriotism and civic duty are absent.</description>

      <description>From Michael Shermer’s review of Robert Frank’s The Darwin Economy:
[S]exual selection may very well account for most of characteristics that we so admire about our species: art, music, humor, literature, poetry, fashion, dance and, more generally, creativity and intelligence. Science itself may be a byproduct of the cognitive process of trying to impress others in order to gain status and mates by making breakthrough discoveries and formulating important new theories.</description>

      <description>I finished a post last week with the question of whether children are normal goods. Below I want to lay out some economic arguments on this, before putting in an evolutionary twist that raises the question of whether we can rely on any of the economic analysis.
A normal good is a good for which demand increases with income. Cars, holidays and jewellery are examples of normal goods. The opposite is an inferior good, with demand decreasing as income rises.</description>

      <description>Diane Coyle has noted the release of three new books on the evolution of cooperation: Wired for Culture by Mark Pagel, Beyond Human Nature by Jesse Prinz and Together by Richard Sennett. Each was reviewed by Robin McKie in the Guardian
A quick glance at some reviews, such as this by Julian Baggini, suggests that evolution is at the heart of Pagel’s discussion of the development of culture, with a fundamental question being how does human culture affect transmission of genes.</description>

      <description>As happens occasionally, I have just come across an article that I should have seen years ago. In an article titled Natural Selection on Male Wealth in Humans, Daniel Nettle and Thomas Pollet look at data from a variety of societies, ranging from subsistence groups to industrialised societies, and show that the link between male income and reproductive success is strong and ubiquitous.
In their main analysis, they use longitudinal data for a group of British men born in a single week in March 1958.</description>

      <description>After copping some criticism for his comments on the coverage of female contraception in health insurance, Steven Landsburg has noted that some arguments in its favour may have merit. Two of the more interesting he notes are as follows:
We might not want to discourage parenthood in general, but surely we want to discourage parenthood by the sort of woman who won’t use contraception unless it’s subsidised. Ideally we’d tax childbirth among that class of women, but since they’re hard to identify, the best available policy is to subsidize contraception.</description>

      <description>Consider a country, with population average IQ of 100, that opens its borders and the population doubles as people with a average IQ of 80 enter from a neighbouring country. The populations of the United States and United Kingdom have average IQs around 100, while the populations of countries such as India and Central America have average IQs around 80. There is generally more than an order of magnitude difference in per capita GDP between the populations with 80 IQ and 100 IQ.</description>

      <description>Even after controlling for observable traits such as IQ, married men earn more. Bryan Caplan suggests there are three economic explanations for this male marriage premium:
 Ability bias: Qualities that make a man attractive to a woman are also attractive to employers. Human capital: Marriage makes men more productive. Signalling: Marriage signals to employers that a man has desirable traits.  Caplan notes a study that argues that ability bias accounts for less than 10 per cent of the premium.</description>

      <description>From Daniel Kahneman&amp;rsquo;s Thinking, Fast and Slow:
Much is therefore at stake in the debate between the Chicago school and the behavioral economists, who reject the extreme form of the rational-agent model. Freedom is not a contested value; all the participants in the debate are in favor of it. But life is more complex for behavioral economists than for true believers in human rationality. No behavioral economist favors a state that will force its citizens to eat a balanced diet and to watch only television programs that are good for the soul.</description>

      <description>To make his point that socioeconomic status is a major driver of educational outcomes, Dan Pink made the following chart. SAT scores are on the vertical axis, and family incomes on the horizontal axis.
Sidestepping questions of what this correlation actually means, is there any plausible scenario that would result in a different relationship?
If we assume, as many are using the chart to assert, that parental income &amp;ldquo;buys&amp;rdquo; higher SAT scores, then we will see SAT scores rising with income.</description>

      <description>In Tim Harford’s discussion in Adapt of the benefits to experimentation , Harford notes that experimentation by individuals is often at great potential cost. As when a species evolves, what appears to be beneficial experimentation at a societal level involves frequent failure to survive by individuals. While Harford suggests that people should consider experimenting in a manner that avoids failure that threatens survival, the reality is that many people take risks with a large downside.</description>

      <description>Natural selection operates through heritable variation in traits and differential reproductive success due to those traits. Many combinations of genes and mutations are failures, but the variation in traits creates a natural experiment in which highly evolved solutions to the environment can develop.
In his excellent book Adapt: Why Success Always Starts with Failure, Tim Harford applies this evolutionary concept to business, war, accidents and other human pursuits. How did on-the-ground experimentation lead to a better outcome in Iraq?</description>

      <description>The title of this post comes from a 2002 paper by Paul Zak and Kwang Woo Park. The title is mildly deceptive, as the paper has many elements and ideas crammed into it beyond population genetics. The model described by the authors includes working, consumption, saving, marriage, genetic diversity, sexual selection, intelligence, beauty, education, the Flynn effect, family size effects and more. While many of these elements deserve consideration, this is ultimately the paper&amp;rsquo;s weakness.</description>

      <description>In The Folly of Fools: The Logic of Deceit and Self-Deception in Human Life, Robert Trivers asks “Is economics a science?” He answers:
The short answer is no. Economics acts like a science and quacks like one - it has developed an impressive mathematical apparatus and awards itself a Nobel Prize each year - but it is not yet a science. It fails to ground itself in underlying knowledge (in this case, biology).</description>

      <description>Robert Trivers is one of the giants of biology. His work in altruism, parental investment and parent-offspring conflict is seminal. For this, he has been justly rewarded.
Trivers&amp;rsquo;s later work on deception and self-deception is also important. His basic argument is that self-deception is not irrationality in the way we might normally categorise it. Rather self-deception plays an important role in convincing others of the &amp;ldquo;truth&amp;rdquo;. Believing in something prevents one from giving signs of deception, while possibly reducing cognitive load.</description>

Although in its history rules of immigration have favored some groups over others, all have had some opportunity.</description>

      <description>Robin Hansen writes on the sex selective abortion of females:
A simple supply and demand analysis says that selective abortion both _expresses_ a preference for boys and _causes_ a reduction in that preference as wives become scarce. In South Korea this process is mostly complete, with excess girls down from 15% in the 1990s to 7% today (with ~5% as the biologically natural excess). ...Over an evolutionary time scale, the pay-offs to male and female children is, on average, equal, which would tend to balance numbers.</description>

More interesting and important is the possibility that children born after abortion legalization may on average have lower subsequent rates of criminality for either of two reasons. First, women who have abortions are those most at risk to give birth to children who would engage in criminal activity.</description>

If war would weed out only the criminal, the vicious, the feeble-minded, the insane, the habitual paupers, and others of the defective classes, it might lay claim, with some show of justice, to the beneficent virtues sometimes ascribed to it.But the truth is that its effects are diametrically opposite. It eliminates the young men, who should be the fathers of the next generation - men medically selected as the largest, strongest, most alert, and best endowed in every way, and at the very age when they normally would be performing the most important function which men can perform, that of fathering posterity.</description>

The story I tell for bimodalism is mating behavior. When high earners marry high earners, class divisions will emerge. But this has implications for the IQ distribution. One would expect bimodalism to appear in the IQ distribution, with the children of high-IQ parents tending centered around one mode and the children of low-IQ parents centered around another.Kling&amp;rsquo;s expectation depends on our assumptions about the nature of the assortive mating.</description>

      <description>The core message of Sheldon Garon&amp;rsquo;s Beyond Our Means: Why America Spends While the World Saves is that people&amp;rsquo;s savings behaviour responds to incentives and in particular, to the institutional structure and norms created by government. These incentives range from the availability of convenient savings accounts to the establishment of social norms.
The incentives described by Garon are not those typically discussed by economists. Garon argues that economics has failed to explain cross-national differences in savings and that the life-cycle hypothesis of savings does poorly.</description>

The closest substitute, the Crafoord Prize in Biosciences, is awarded once every four years, with the winner chosen by the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences. The Academy also participates in deciding the Nobel prizes for Chemistry and Physics and Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences.</description>

      <description>In Freeman Dyson&amp;rsquo;s interesting review of Daniel Kahneman&amp;rsquo;s Thinking, Fast and Slow, Dyson describes a couple of examples of the biases identified by Kahneman. One of them is as follows:
The endowment effect is our tendency to value an object more highly when we own it than when someone else owns it. ...In poor agrarian societies, such as Ireland in the nineteenth century or much of Africa today, the endowment effect works for evil because it perpetuates poverty.</description>

I haven&amp;rsquo;t read enough books published in 2011 to be able to apply a decent filter, plus there are many books out there that we should not forget. In no particular order:
Flatland: a romance of many dimensions by Edwin Abbott - Clever, fun satire
Sex, Genes &amp;amp; Rock &amp;lsquo;N&amp;rsquo; Roll: How Evolution has Shaped the Modern World by Rob Brooks - While the book is generally a fun read, it makes this list for two specific parts: the discussions of sexual conflict in the context of population and on obesity (my discussion of the obesity chapter).</description>

      <description>Philip Zimbardo&amp;rsquo;s The Lucifer Effect: Understanding How Good People Turn Evil focuses on a message that the situation is more important than the person&amp;rsquo;s disposition. Good people can do evil things if placed in the wrong situation.
One of my main responses to this message was that the disposition of other people forms part of my situation. Disposition and situation cannot be neatly disentangled.
This is similar to the case of IQ and income.</description>

      <description>The situation is more important than a person&amp;rsquo;s disposition. This message permeates through Philip Zimbardo’s The Lucifer Effect: Understanding How Good People Turn Evil, and while I disagree with some of the implications that he draws from this message, Zimbardo’s case is compelling.
Zimbardo builds the book on the Stanford Prison Experiment, one of the most cited psychological experiments. Zimbardo and his colleagues selected a group of “psychologically normal” young men and randomly assigned them roles as guards and prisoners in a role-play that they would conduct in the basement at Stanford University.</description>

      <description>From 100 years ago, Scientific American calls for more research into human evolution:
Mendelian principles have no doubt long been followed by professional animal breeders in an empirical way, but only within recent years have enough data been accumulated to show that they apply with equal force to human beings. We know enough about the laws of heredity, we have enough statistics from insane asylums and prisons, we have enough genealogies, to show that, although we may not be able directly to improve the human race as we improve the breed of guinea pigs, rabbits or cows, because of the rebellious spirit of mankind, yet the time has come when the lawmaker should join hands with the scientist, and at least check the propagation of the unfit.</description>

The authors argue that “genoeconomics”, the use of molecular genetics in economics, has the potential to supplement traditional behavioural genetic studies and build an understanding of the biology underlying economically relevant traits.</description>

      <description>The heritability straw man has copped another bashing, this time in the Journal of Economic Perspectives. In it, Charles Manski picks up an old line of argument by Goldberger from 1979 and argues that heritability research is uninformative for the analysis of policy.
Manski starts by arguing that heritability estimates are based on the assumption that there is no gene-environment correlation. Manski writes:
The assumption that g and e are uncorrelated is at odds with the reasonable conjecture that persons who inherit relatively strong genetic endowments tend to grow up in families with more favorable environments for child development.</description>

      <description>In Benoit Debreuil&amp;rsquo;s Human Evolution and the Origins of Hierarchies, the opening chapter contains the interesting argument that egalitarian hunter-gatherer societies were not built on a wish for equality. Dubreuil writes:
Egalitarian social arrangements must build on what Boehm (1999: 66) called an “egalitarian ethos,” which is culturally constructed and transmitted and does not straightforwardly result from our passion for equality. This does not mean that equality does not matter per se.</description>

      <description>I missed it when it first went up, but over at The Crux, Discover&amp;rsquo;s new group blog, Razib Khan has pointed to a couple of interesting papers on the heritability of fertility. As natural selection acts strongly on fertility and the traits that affect it, you might expect that the heritability of fertility would be low as variation is eliminated. But change the environment, and heritability can increase drastically. Razib writes:</description>

      <description>Benoit Dubreuil&amp;rsquo;s Human Evolution and the Origins of Hierarchies seeks to explain two historical transitions in social hierarchies in human (and pre-human) history. The first is the transition from dominance hierarchies, such as those lived in by our common ancestor with the chimpanzee, to egalitarian social relationships. The second is from those egalitarian relationships to the large-scale, state-based hierarchies we see today.
The assumption as to the existence of the first transition is largely taken from the work of Christopher Boehm (Hierarchy in the Forest: The Evolution of Egalitarian Behavior).</description>

      <description>In an evolutionary sense, resource inequality affects survival and access to mates. While the current “Occupy” debates about growing inequality and the power of the 1 per cent are very much focused on the resource issue, the underlying reason people have an innate aversion to the unequal distribution of power (or, more particularly, their being at the wrong end of that distribution) comes back to these evolutionary factors. But to what extent are survival and reproduction actually affected by the inequality being protested?</description>

      <description>I have finally finished reading Francis Fukuyama&amp;rsquo;s The Origins of Political Order: From Prehuman Times to the French Revolution, several months after my initial comments.
Of the grand history books I have read this year (the others being Ian Morris&amp;rsquo;s Why the West Rules for Now and Niall Ferguson&amp;rsquo;s Civilization: The West and the Rest), I found Fukuyama&amp;rsquo;s to be the most convincing. The focus on self-interest as a motivating factor of the individual actor, which is in turn underpinned by biological considerations, creates a more plausible story than one which talks of nations as actors.</description>

      <description>From Charles Manski in the latest Journal of Economic Perspectives (pdf):
Someone reading empirical research relating human genetics to personal outcomes must be careful to distinguish two types of work. An old literature on heritability attempts to decompose cross-sectional variation in observed outcomes into unobservable genetic and environmental components. A new literature measures specifific genes and uses them as observed covariates when predicting outcomes. I will discuss these two types of work in terms of how they may inform social policy.</description>

      <description>Scott Haufman has written a post on the variation in IQ over a person&amp;rsquo;s life. He writes:
In 1932, the entire population of Scottish 11-year-olds (87, 498 children) took an IQ test. Over 60 years later, psychologists Ian Deary and Lawrence Whalley tracked down about 500 of them and gave them the same test to take again.Turns out, the correlation was strikingly high &amp;ndash; .66, to be exact. Those who were at the top of the pack at age 11 also tended to be at the top of the pack at age 80, and those who were at the bottom also tended to stay at the bottom.</description>

The second involves an experiment with capuchin monkeys:
A similar lesson emerges from a classic experiment conducted by Franz de Waals and Sarah Brosnan. The primatologists trained brown capuchin monkeys to give them pebbles in exchange for cucumbers.</description>

      <description>While IQ research seems to be be emerging from its taboo phase, Anneli Rufus has written an article in Alternet which asks why the study of human intelligence was off the agenda for so long.
The analysis points to the usual suspects - the shadow of eugenics and racial research - but the article does have a couple of interesting quotes from Stephen Murdoch and Dennis Garlick. First, in much of the literature on IQ, the focus is on finding &amp;lsquo;g&amp;rsquo;, a single measure of general intelligence.</description>

      <description>From the Journal of Personality and Social Psychology:
Much research shows that people are loss averse, meaning that they weigh losses more heavily than gains. Drawing on an evolutionary perspective, we propose that although loss aversion might have been adaptive for solving challenges in the domain of self-protection, this may not be true for men in the domain of mating. Three experiments examine how loss aversion is influenced by mating and self-protection motives.</description>

There are many statistical predictors of violence that we choose not to use in our decision-making for moral and political reasons, because the ideal of fairness trumps the ideal of cost-effectiveness.

The extraordinary variation in fertility in Man has been noticed in a somewhat different manner by Dr. D. Heron, using material provided by the deaths (30,285 males and 21,892 females) recorded in the Commonwealth of Australia for 1912. Heron finds that half of the total number of children come from families of 8 or more, which are supplied by only one-ninth of the men or one-seventh of the women of the previous generation.</description>

      <description>In his new book, The Darwin Economy: Liberty, Competition, and the Common Good, Robert Frank argues that within the next century, Charles Darwin will become known as the intellectual founder of economics, displacing Adam Smith from that role (my book review here). Frank&amp;rsquo;s prediction rests on the contrasting perspectives on competition provided by the two. Smith had the counterintuitive insight that selfish actions could increase the common good, while Darwin recognised that competition could be wasteful as individuals compete for survival and mates.</description>

      <description>Adam Smith&amp;rsquo;s invisible hand metaphor is one of the most powerful ideas in economics. Individual action, even in the pursuit of pure self-interest, can serve the interests of others.
Charles Darwin&amp;rsquo;s evolution by natural selection is an even more powerful idea in the world of evolutionary biology. In Darwin&amp;rsquo;s world, individual actions can be at the expense of others, as competition for survival or mates can leave others out in the cold.</description>

National Football League quarterbacks who are more attractive are paid greater salaries and this premium persists after controlling for player performance.This is relatively consistent with the picture painted in Dan Hamermesh&amp;rsquo;s Beauty Pays: Why Attractive People Are More Successful, which I reviewed recently.</description>

      <description>In a post earlier this month, Eric Johnson put together an interesting argument on the evolution of collective violence (I recommend reading his whole post).
Johnson opens with some of the arguments that group violence is a consequence of our evolutionary history. One of this arguments is the called the Elaborated Social Identity Model of crowd behaviour:
Each individual remains a rational actor, but has been primed by natural selection to identify with the group during a period of crisis.</description>

      <description>Larry Arnhart’s recent post at Darwinian Conservatism makes a couple of interesting points on family values and classical liberalism. The piece is largely a response to Geoffrey Hodgson’s claim that a market individualist cannot support family values:
“Generally, if contract and trade are always the best way of organising matters, then many functions that are traditionally organised in a different manner should become commercialized . . . Pushed to the limit, market individualism implies the commercialization of sex and the abolition of the family.</description>

      <description>Ronald Bailey has written an article for Reason on Randy Thornhill and Corey Fincher&amp;rsquo;s work linking disease and liberalisation. Bailey writes:
Thornhill and Fincher argue that the risk of infectious disease affects elites’ willingness to share power and resources, the general social acceptance of hierarchical authority, and the population’s openness to innovation. Their central idea is that ethnocentrism and out-group avoidance function as a kind of behavioral immune system. Just as individuals have immune systems that fight pathogens, groups of people evolve with local parasites and develop some resistance to them.</description>

In the article, Wilkinson addresses the link between capitalism and human nature. On property rights, he states:
Property rights are prefigured in nature by the way animals mark out territories for their exclusive use in foraging, hunting, and mating.</description>

      <description>The WSJ has published an essay by Steven Pinker on the decline of violence, which is adapted from his upcoming book The Better Angels of Our Nature: Why Violence Has Declined. Pinker points out six major declines in violence in human history, starting with the shift from the hunter-gatherer life:
The first was a process of pacification: the transition from the anarchy of the hunting, gathering and horticultural societies in which our species spent most of its evolutionary history to the first agricultural civilizations, with cities and governments, starting about 5,000 years ago.</description>

Hunter-gatherers keep their neighbours and tribe-mates in line. When everybody depends on everyone else, then reputation rules. You simply can&#39;t afford to be selfish, whether by failing to share or by freeloading, in a small community. Your allies will desert you.</description>

      <description>There is another interesting topic in this month&amp;rsquo;s Cato Unbound, with Michael Shermer arguing in the lead essay that human nature is best represented by the libertarian political philosophy.
Shermer (rightly) spends most of the essay shooting down the blank slate vision of humans that underpins many policies on the left, and suggests that moderates on both the left and right should accept a &amp;ldquo;Realistic vision&amp;rdquo; of human nature. He then simply states that the libertarian philosophy best represents this vision.</description>

      <description>Over at the Evolutionary Psychology Blog, Robert Kurzban has posted a fairly harsh take-down of a paper by Roy Baumeister and Kathleen Vohs.
The paper proposes that as sex is a scarce resource offered by women, it can be subject to economic analysis. From this, they come to some predictions such as men offering women other resources for sex.
Kurzban notes that the paper is a rehashing of work that dates back to Robert Trivers in 1972 and Don Symons in 1979.</description>

      <description>As opportunity is equalised, more of the variation in outcomes between people will be due to genetic factors. This may have the somewhat ironic result of reducing social mobility.
I generally take the view that assortment by genetic lottery is no more fair than assortment based on social factors such as being born to low socio-economic status parents. An alternative view is given by Garret Hardin in his famous article The Tragedy of the Commons, when he writes of the private property solution to the tragedy:</description>

Milton Friedman sums up his celebrated polemic against realism in theory (1953, p. 41, italics supplied): Complete “realism” is clearly unattainable, and the question whether a theory is realistic “enough” can be settled only be seeing whether it yields predictions that are good enough for the purpose in hand or that are better than predictions from alternative theories.</description>

Consider: what elites did foragers worry most about? Foragers worried most about elite capacity for violence, and an inclination to use it. They also worried lots about unequal access to food and shelter, and to tools useful for all these things. So foragers enforced strong norms against giving orders or doing violence, and norms favoring sharing of food, shelter, and tools. In these senses foragers were egalitarian.However, foragers worried far less about unequal capacities for art, music, conversation, charm, social popularity, or sex appeal.</description>

      <description>It&amp;rsquo;s not normally a good sign when an attempt to skewer measurement of heritability opens with a link between genetics and eugenics via Francis Galton, and Brian Palmer&amp;rsquo;s critique of twin studies is no exception (HT Razib at Gene Expression).
Twin studies are one of the primary methods to estimate the heritability of a trait. As monozygotic (identical) twins are more genetically similar than dizygotic (fraternal) twins, the similarity between identical twins and fraternal twins can be used to infer heritability.</description>

      <description>A new book has just popped out - The Epigenetics Revolution by Nessa Carey - and accompanying it is the usual epigenetics-related suggestions that Darwin was wrong. Take this from Peter Forbes in the Guardian:
[E]pigenetics finally reaches that &#34;everything you&#39;ve been told is wrong&#34; moment when it claims that some epigenetic changes are so long-lasting they cover several generations: they can be inherited. This flouts one of biology&#39;s most cherished dogmas – taught to all students – namely that changes acquired during life cannot be passed on – the heresy of Lamarckism.</description>

I agree with Hardin&amp;rsquo;s sentiment. As I have advocated in this blog before, economics would be much richer, have more predictive power and offer a better description of the world if economists used the fact that humans are a product of billions of years of evolution and this process shaped our traits and preferences.</description>

That’s because it means more marriageable men for every women. ...But once a woman enters into a polygamous arrangement, it seems she’d have less power. Bargaining power in a household is often based on who contributes what to household production and utility. Each person provides certain services and resources to make the household function and this keeps the marriage balanced.</description>

      <description>From Dan Ariely:
Last year, the Danish government announced that sterilization, which had been free, would cost at least 7,000 kroner (~$1,300) for men and 13,000 kroner (~$2,500) for women as of January 1st, 2011. Following the announcement, doctors performing sterilizations found that their patient load suddenly surged. People were scrambling to get sterilized while it was still free.Now, it could be that the people who were already planning on getting sterilized at some point in the future just made their appointments a bit sooner, and conveniently saved some money.</description>

      <description>A post on Cheap Talk reminded me about an old paper of Bill Hamilton&amp;rsquo;s on the potential for extraordinary sex ratios. Apart from its importance for the particular topic (Hamilton considered it to be one of his best papers), it is one of the more interesting expositions that what is good for the individual (or more specifically, the gene) may not be good for the species. It also raises the implicit question of how quickly something can return to equilibrium.</description>

Pop economists (or, at least, pop micro-economists) are often making one of two arguments:  People are rational and respond to incentives. Behavior that looks irrational is actually completely rational once you think like an economist.
  People are irrational and they need economists, with their open minds, to show them how to be rational and efficient.

      <description>A paper that is getting some attention at the moment is a critique of evolutionary psychology by Bolhuis and colleagues, titled Darwin in Mind: New Opportunities for Evolutionary Psychology. They critique a number of tenets of the &amp;ldquo;Santa Barbara school of evolutionary psychology&amp;rdquo;, including the notion that human psychological mechanisms evolved in response to stable ancestral environments or that there is a universal human nature.
As there has been some commentary on the general point of the article by some other bloggers (check out John Hawks or Razib at Gene Expression), I won&amp;rsquo;t spend much time questioning the accuracy of the critique or the lack of concrete suggestions by Bolhuis and colleagues.</description>

      <description>Rob Brooks has posted an article (also published in The Conversation) outlining his argument that the relatively cheap price of carbohydrates compared to the price of protein is driving the obesity crisis. Drawing on material from his book Sex, Genes and Rock &amp;lsquo;n&amp;rsquo; Roll: How Evolution Has Shaped the Modern World, Rob argues that as our recent evolutionary history involved a diet of lean meat and high fibre plant foods, modern humans are poorly evolved for the cheap simple carbohydrates that dominate many modern diets.</description>

      <description>I have started reading Francis Fukuyama&amp;rsquo;s The Origins of Political Order and am enjoying his starting point of human prehistory. I will write a full review when I have finished, but in the meantime, some of Fukuyama&amp;rsquo;s initial observations are worth noting. In particular, he takes biology to be the foundation of our understanding of political development.
To understand this, then, we need to go back to the state of nature and to human biology, which in some sense sets the framework for the whole of human politics.</description>

The reasons that churches lose ground in developed countries can be summarized in market terms. First, with better science, and with government safety nets, and smaller families, there is less fear and uncertainty in people&#39;s daily lives and hence less of a market for religion.</description>

Jared Diamond in his famous text actually has has a throw away reference to this, where he speculates that New Guinea tribesmen are actually much smarter than Europeans because New Guinea tribesmen live by their wits, whereas Europeans it was their gut bacteria that determined whether they survived or not. And I actually knew that cities in Europe had very poor survival rates, that that&#39;s where the educated people were, and I expected going into this to show that we were all, the current Europeans, were the remnants of rural idiocy.</description>

A recent line of research demonstrates that cognitive skills—intelligence quotient scores, math skills, and the like—have only a modest influence on individual wages, but are strongly correlated with national outcomes. Is this largely due to human capital spillovers? This paper argues that the answer is yes.</description>

      <description>Yesterday I visited Down House, Charles Darwin&amp;rsquo;s home from 1842 until his death in 1882. Darwin wrote most of his major works there. The house contained a lot of interesting artefacts and bits of information, but one of the more interesting was a copy of Das Kapitalsent from Karl Marx to Darwin. Inscribed inside the book was:
Mr. Charles DarwinOn the part of his sincere admirerKarl MarxLondon 16 June 1873Modena VillasMaitland ParkSeeing this, I did a quick search to find out the extent to which Marx was in contact with and influenced by Darwin (having not yet read Das Kapital) and it seems that there is a history of storytelling and exaggeration around it.</description>

But the most striking thing about the growing derivatives markets is the stability that has come with them. More than eight years ago, after Long-Term Capital Management blew up and lost a few billion dollars, the Federal Reserve had to be wheeled in to save capitalism as we know it.</description>

      <description>Paul Krugman&amp;rsquo;s oft-quoted critique of Stephen Jay Gould is one of the more brutal dismissals of his work (it is from a 1996 speech on what economists can learn from evolutionary theorists):
Now it is not very hard to find out, if you spend a little while reading in evolution, that Gould is the John Kenneth Galbraith of his subject. That is, he is a wonderful writer who is beloved by literary intellectuals and lionized by the media because he does not use algebra or difficult jargon.</description>

He made statistical inquiries into the efficacy of prayer - he got into trouble for that for he found that those people frequently prayed for, like monarchs, lived no longer than anyone else. He even made a beauty map of Britain, based on a secret grading of the local women on a scale from attractive to repulsive (the low point was in Aberdeen).</description>

This threshold issue extends beyond crime. Take IQ, which is highly heritable and correlates with income and most other life outcomes.</description>

      <description>The July/August 2011 edition of the Atlantic has a great article by David Eagleman on the implications of advances in brain science on the way we approach crime (HT: Jeffrey Horn). Eagleman argues that these advances will require a reshaping of the criminal justice system to reflect the declining gap between whether actions can be attributed to biology and free will. Eagleman writes:
Technology will continue to improve, and as we grow better at measuring problems in the brain, the fault line will drift into the territory of people we currently hold fully accountable for their crimes.</description>

      <description>Niall Ferguson has a slight Malthusian thread running through his book, Civilization: The West and the Rest. At one point, Ferguson touches on the mass emigration from England to the Americas. Ferguson writes:
 [A]s England’s population accelerated in the late seventeenth century, overseas expansion played a vital role in propelling the country out of the Malthusian trap. Transatlantic trade brought an influx of new nutrients like potatoes and sugar – an acre of sugar cane yielded the same amount of energy as 12 acres of wheat – as well as plentiful cod and herring.</description>

Ferguson attributes the West&amp;rsquo;s ascension to six &amp;ldquo;killer apps&amp;rdquo;: competition, science, property rights, medicine, the consumer society and work ethic. As the West possessed all six of these apps, it was able to dominate the world for 500 years, with no other region possessing the full combination.</description>

      <description>In Geoffrey Miller&amp;rsquo;s Spent: Sex, Evolution, and Consumer Behavior (earlier posts on his book here, here and here - this is the last one for now), Miller discusses how there might be a move away from a consumerist culture. To do this, there is a need to develop and maintain social norms that could act as an alternative to the typical displays of wealth. For example, in a religious community, signalling could be through time and resources given to the church.</description>

      <description>For most of Geoffrey Miller&amp;rsquo;s Spent: Sex, Evolution, and Consumer Behavior(earlier posts here and here), Miller treats the genetic influences on human preferences as relatively static over human history. However, in his discussion of the big-five personality trait of conscientiousness, Miller suggests that high conscientiousness was only selected for after the Neolithic Revolution:
In several respects, conscientiousness is an unusual personality trait. Because hunter-gatherer life did not require as much planning and memory for debts and duties as life in larger-scale societies with more complex divisions of labor, conscientiousness may have evolved to higher average levels only recently, and perhaps to a greater degree in some populations than others.</description>

      <description>Geoffrey Miller&amp;rsquo;s main thesis in Spent: Sex, Evolution and Consumer Behavior is that the conspicuous consumption we use to signal traits such as intelligence, agreeableness or conscientiousness is unnecessarily indirect. Instead, we should use our evolved abilities to show these characteristics through humour, communication and interaction with others. Miller summarises his position as follows:
Consumerist capitalism is largely an exercise in gilding the lily. We take wondrously adaptive capacities for human self-display - language, intelligence, kindness, creativity, and beauty - and then forget how to use them in making friends, attracting mates, and gaining prestige.</description>

In one of the earlier chapters, Miller discusses Maslow&amp;rsquo;s hierarchy of needs. The hierarchy, from the base to the top, consists of physiological, safety, love, esteem and self-actualisation needs. It is only on satisfaction of the first four needs that one will focus on self actualisation, which includes (among other things) morality, creativity and discovery.</description>

Having been through the process of parametrising and simulating a complex economic model, I would recommend it as a method of increasing understanding of the basic model mechanics. More importantly, it can also highlight issues that are not clear from the mathematical consideration that is traditionally given to models.</description>

      <description>In my last post, I discussed Oded Galor and Omer Moav&amp;rsquo;s paper Natural Selection and the Origin of Economic Growth. As I noted then, my PhD supervisors, Juerg Weber and Boris Baer, and I have written a discussion paper that describes a simulation of the model.
In the discussion paper we discuss an extension of the model in which we consider the entry of people into the population that have a low preference for child quality - i.</description>

      <description>Natural Selection and the Origin of Economic Growth by Oded Galor and Omer Moav is somewhat of an outlier. I&amp;rsquo;m not aware of any other paper that models the Industrial Revolution as a result of natural selection, apart from a similar paper by Galor and Michalopoulos. Zak and Park wrote a paper that examines population genetics and economic growth but they do not directly tackle the Industrial Revolution. In A Farewell to Alms, Greg Clark notes that Galor and Moav&amp;rsquo;s paper reignited his interest in this topic, but Clark does not model his hypothesis.</description>

      <description>I was flipping through Chuck Palahniuk&amp;rsquo;s Fight Club last night, one of my favourite books. I hadn&amp;rsquo;t given much thought to this before, but I was wondering what motivated the space monkeys to join Project Mayhem. The novel hints that the space monkeys are a mix of lower status occupations. They are probably single and not actively participating in the mating market. So, to what extent would participation in Project Mayhem attract women?</description>

      <description>I have just started reading Geoffrey Miller&amp;rsquo;s Spent. It opens with a mildly amusing faux discussion in which a modern person seeks to convince some Cro-Magnons of the benefits of the modern way of life. The modern person is unable to do so as the discussion focuses on how the modern way of life does not increase the ability to attract and hold a mate (as opposed to, say, the rate of child mortality).</description>

      <description>Over the weekend I read Diane Coyle&amp;rsquo;s The Economics of Enough. I particularly enjoyed her dismantling of the concept that to increase happiness we should forget about growth. My reading list on this area has increased considerably - and it seems that I should place Amartya Sen high on that list. Coyle writes:
Those researchers like Richard Layard and Robert Frank who believe the link between growth and happiness tails off to nothing above a certain income level argue for taxes to make people stop working so hard or spend less on various consumer goods.</description>

      <description>Recently, I was asked whether the idea that I was espousing - considering human evolution in economics - was dangerous. For a perspective on debating dangerous ideas, it was suggested that it was worthwhile reading Steven Pinker&amp;rsquo;s introduction to the book What is Your Dangerous Idea? (HT Erik Postma).
Pinker argues both for and against treating some ideas as dangerous and possibly limiting their discussion. In addition to the usual arguments such as sunlight being the best disinfectant and that people will twist the debates to suit their own purposes, Pinker made some interesting observations.</description>

I had the pleasure of presenting to some behavioural ecologists at the University of Zurich and was advocating for more &amp;ldquo;evolutionary biology imperialism&amp;rdquo; in economics. In the way that economists charge out of their field and seek to spread wisdom on everything, I want to see more evolutionary biologists doing the same and giving their perspectives on economics.</description>

      <description>In all the debates about human biases, I like to believe that there is some benefit to being right. There must be some evolutionary benefit to knowing the true state of the world (on average). That is not to say that the benefits will always outweigh the costs, as the aim is to reproduce. Attracting a mate or surviving within a group may require holding some beliefs, such as religion. However, knowing that the snake will kill you will have fitness benefits.</description>

      <description>Thorstein Veblen has been ranked seventh in a poll of economists on their favourite, dead, 20th century economist. He ranked behind Keynes, Friedman, Samuelson, Hayek, Schumpeter and Galbraith. His supporters were among the least liberal (in the classical sense of the word) of the survey participants. Given his approach to consumerism and the leisure class, as detailed in The Theory of the Leisure Class, this is no surprise. Following from my earlier posts on the book (here and here), I have finished reading it, with the rest of the book largely applying Veblen&amp;rsquo;s framework to sport, religion and education.</description>

      <description>The media and blogosphere has dedicated plenty of column and blog inches to a recently published study by Danziger and colleagues on how parole rates by Israeli judges vary through the day. From the abstract:
We record the judges’ two daily food breaks, which result in segmenting the deliberations of the day into three distinct “decision sessions.” We find that the percentage of favorable rulings drops gradually from ≈65% to nearly zero within each decision session and returns abruptly to ≈65% after a break.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m back on the population bandwagon today, and I wanted to define a point where economists and ecologists often appear to be talking across each other (and where I disagree with both). The best way to delineate this is by revisiting the Julian Simon-Paul Ehrlich bet.
Simon and Ehrlich entered into a wager in 1980 as to whether five metals would increase or decrease in price over the next ten years.</description>

      <description>Belief in evolution is often considered the domain of &amp;ldquo;the left&amp;rdquo;. Apart from being true, evolutionary theory provides a ground for opposition to creationists. It is often used to argue that competition can be wasteful and that self-organising systems (such as the economy) do not always operate for the good of society. However, evolutionary psychology has not been embraced to the same extent. Ever since Gould and Lewontin led the sociobiology wars against E O Wilson and others, the concept that evolution shaped human minds has faced much opposition, even among those who otherwise accept that evolution is true.</description>

      <description>Given the recent discussion on population that the release of Bryan Caplan&amp;rsquo;s Selfish Reason to Have Kids has triggered (my posts here, here and here), I have been contemplating some physical limits of what the ultimate human population could be. The current global population is around 6.8 billion and is growing at around 1.2 per cent per year. Let us suppose that the population growth rate persists (as I argued before, there is a case to argue that it might increase).</description>

      <description>Robert Frank has written a piece for the New York Times on why worrying is good. He writes of the well-known phenomena that after large life changes, people&amp;rsquo;s level of happiness tends to drift back to where it was before the event. Humans are also particularly bad at predicting this effect, placing far more importance on events before they occur than the later effect on happiness would warrant.
The point of Frank&amp;rsquo;s post is how much sense this makes from an evolutionary perspective.</description>

It hasn&amp;rsquo;t got any easier to read, but Veblen&amp;rsquo;s interesting observations on conspicuous consumption, beauty and evolution keep flowing.
One of his more interesting perspectives is on how costliness masquerades under the name of beauty. Veblen argues that cost determines what is considered beautiful, with the marks of expensiveness becoming known as beauty.</description>

The two reasons most often cited for this is are high levels of fertility in the Hispanic immigrant population and the high level of fertility of religious people. Even when you control for income and education, religious people have more children than non-religious people (on average).</description>

      <description>Like all economists, I am familiar with the concept of the tragedy of the commons. However, possibly like most economists, I had not read Garrett Hardin&amp;rsquo;s 1968 article from where we derive the phrase - that is, until yesterday. As a result, I did not understand the extent to which overpopulation concerns underpinned Hardin&amp;rsquo;s writing (HT: Daniel Rankin).
Much of Hardin&amp;rsquo;s career focussed on overpopulation. He wrote one article called Living on a Lifeboat in which he argued that the lives saved by food aid would only make life worse for later generations (a Malthusian world).</description>

      <description>I have started reading Thorstein Veblen&amp;rsquo;s The Theory of the Leisure Class. The book was published in 1899 and was one of the earliest books to explore the classical economic concept that people wish to consume more.
I am finding it hard to read the book straight through (despite some classic satire), so I will break up my review into parts. This post covers the first five chapters. As I finish the book over the next week or so, I&amp;rsquo;ll post on the rest.</description>

      <description>Bryan Caplan has a simple recommendation. Have more kids. If you have one, have another. If you have two, consider three or four. As Caplan spells out in his book, Selfish Reasons to Have More Kids, children have higher private benefits than most people think. Research shows that parents can take it easy, as there is not much they can change about their children. He also argues that there are social benefits to a higher population, with more people leading to more ideas, which are the foundation of modern economic growth.</description>

      <description>As I noted in yesterday&amp;rsquo;s post, Bryan Caplan has written the lead essay for this month&amp;rsquo;s Cato Unbound on The Politics of Family Size. Caplan argues that as there are strong benefits to increasing population, libertarians should support &amp;ldquo;libertarian policies&amp;rdquo; to increase population, educate and persuade people to have more children and while they are at it, have more children themselves.
Caplan suggests that people underestimate both the social and private benefits of having children.</description>

      <description>This month&amp;rsquo;s Cato Unbound is on The Politics of Family Size. The lead essay is by Bryan Caplan, who is on a mission to get people to have more kids.
Caplan frames his piece around Julian Simon&amp;rsquo;s argument that people are the ultimate resource and that increased population is a good thing. He suggests that decreasing fertility should be worrying for those who believe Simon&amp;rsquo;s argument and he makes a case for libertarian approaches to increasing population (I should note that as Caplan seems to be an optimist, this worry is probably not a case of foreseeing impending doom, but a suggestion that things could be even better).</description>

      <description>Over the Easter break, I read Ian Morris&amp;rsquo;s Why the West Rules- for Now. Morris seeks to develop what might be called a &amp;ldquo;unified theory of history&amp;rdquo; that can shed light on why the West rules the world and not the East. He covers from the emergence of the first members of the genus homo in Africa, through the development of agriculture and the Industrial Revolution to modern times.
Morris looks at his question through the lens of biology, sociology and geography.</description>

      <description>In my last post, I questioned whether a stranger sitting next to you on a train would be more similar to you than an ancestor from 10,000 years ago and **** suggested that this could be tested genetically.
A few issues arise in testing this. First, as I suggested in the last post, the particular ancestor we choose might affect the result. If an ancestor contributed through only a single ancestral line (of the approximately 10^120 lines), any similarity due to ancestry will be very low to negligible, unless that person is, say, a direct male-male ancestor and has contributed the Y-chromosome, much of which does not engage in recombination (that is, the crossover of genes between the chromosomes inherited from ones parents).</description>

To get their result that people would save such that they maximise consumption across generations, Hansson and Stuart assumed that consumption corresponded with fitness (a relative measure of reproductive success). To maximise fitness, one would need to maximise consumption.</description>

      <description>I am at the Social Decision Making: Bridging Economics and Biology conference (the abstracts of which can be downloaded here). As the name suggests, the basic idea behind the conference is to pull together economists and evolutionary biologists to develop new collaborations and examine how their respective approaches to social decision-making might be useful to each other.
So far, the most surprising observation (to me) is how many of the evolutionary biologists are working in the behavioural economics area and conducting experiments with human subjects.</description>

      <description>David Henderson has posted on a recent presentation by Garett Jones of George Mason University in which Jones discussed IQ and cooperation.
As Jones notes, higher IQ people cooperate more in repeated prisoner&amp;rsquo;s dilemma games, are more trusting, have lower levels of divorce and engage more in activities such as voting and organ and cash donation. Jones suggests that if this link between trust and IQ improves a country&amp;rsquo;s institutions, countries should seek to raise national IQ, and one way of achieving this is by boosting immigration of high IQ populations.</description>

      <description>This is my last post on David Sloan Wilson&amp;rsquo;s series Economics and Evolution as Different Paradigms (my earlier three posts are here, here and here). While much of Wilson&amp;rsquo;s attack on economics is against a caricature of the discipline, he ties up his series with a few recommendations that are worth noting.
One is the need for behavioural economics to adopt evolutionary thinking to allow it to move from being a list of anomalies and biases to a coherent framework.</description>

      <description>Jonah Lehrer has expanded his recent focus on measurement and grit (on which I recently posted) in an article on the usefulness of the Wonderlic test, a quasi-IQ test, in predicting quarterback performance. Lehrer cites a paper by David Berri and Rob Simmons which suggests that some metrics, including the Wonderlic test, are influencing draft position even though they are not predictive of performance. Lehrer writes:
While they found that Wonderlic scores play a large role in determining when QBs are selected in the draft -- the only equally important variables are height and the 40-yard dash -- the metric proved all but useless in predicting performance.</description>

      <description>In David Sloan Wilson&amp;rsquo;s blog series Economics and Evolution as Different Paradigms (which I have recently posted about here and here), Wilson discusses the invisible hand metaphor that is used in economics.
The invisible hand metaphor comes from Adam Smith&amp;rsquo;s Wealth of Nations, and although the particular use of the invisible hand metaphor by Smith relates to preferring domestic to foreign industry, the metaphor has come to encapsulate this broader idea of Smith:</description>

      <description>As indicated in my last post, between December 2009 and October 2010, evolutionary biologist David Sloan Wilson wrote a series of posts titled Economics and Evolution as Different Paradigms. Wilson&amp;rsquo;s basic line of reasoning is that evolutionary biology should play a larger role in economics, and I naturally agree with that position.
For the foundation of his argument, the second post of Wilson&amp;rsquo;s series contains a reasonably typical attack on modern economics (I&amp;rsquo;ll accept this monolithic caricature for the moment).</description>

      <description>In the first of a series of blog posts by David Sloan Wilson on economics and evolution (which I will blog about in the coming weeks as the posts contain some interesting ideas), Wilson introduced The Evolution Institute, a think tank that seeks to apply evolutionary theory to modern policy problems.
I had not heard of the Institute before, but naturally I consider that integration of evolutionary thinking into any policy framework can bring value.</description>

      <description>Following from my recent post on Scott Barry Kaufman&amp;rsquo;s heritability measurement nihilism, Jonah Lehrer has gone a step further and taken a swipe at measurement in general, and in particular, at short-term tests. Lehrer argues that:
The larger lesson is that we&#39;ve built our society around tests of performance that fail to predict what really matters: what happens once the test is over.I&amp;rsquo;m not averse to arguments that some people use measurements in inappropriate ways.</description>

      <description>Like the level of selection debate, the debate about what heritability means has a life of its own. The latest shot comes from Scott Barry Kaufman who argues (among other things) that:
The heritability of a trait can vary from 0.00 to 1.00, depending on the environments from which research participants are sampled. Because we know that genes play some role in the development of any trait, the precise heritability estimate doesn&#39;t matter in a practical sense.</description>

      <description>In a post a couple of months or ago as part of a debate on complexity in aid, I recommended Thomas Schelling’s Micromotives and Macrobehavior as a good starting point for understanding complexity science. The book predates a lot of the language associated with complexity science (in fact, I don&amp;rsquo;t think it uses the word complexity at all), but it provides an excellent illustration of some of the basic tenets of complexity science.</description>

Bowles and Gintis sought to explain the observed correlation between parental and child income (a correlation of around 0.</description>

      <description>In a classic behavioural economics story, research participants are offered the choice between one bottle of wine a month from now and two bottles of wine one month and one day from now (alternatively, substitute cake, money or some other pay-off for wine). Most people will choose the two bottles of wine. However, when offered one bottle of wine straight away, more people will take that bottle and not wait until the next day to take up the alternative of two bottles.</description>

      <description>Mike the Mad Biologist has posted this piece on economists&#39; understanding of biology. He pulls apart some statements by Russ Roberts and suggests that if economists are going to use biology as a model for the economics discipline, they should try to understand it first.
Naturally, I agree with this. Apart from preventing the mangling of biological concepts when using a biological analogy, there is a lot in biology that could benefit economics.</description>

      <description>After flipping through Malcolm Gladwell&amp;rsquo;s Outliers: The Story of Success late last year, I have finally read the book (nothing like over 30 hours of travel to get through a few).
Having heard a few podcasts involving Gladwell (such as this), I knew largely what to expect. Gladwell is strongly on the nurture side of the nature-nurture debate and is dismissive of explanations involving the individual or their inherent traits. While he does (at times) concede that nature might play a role, he suggests this is uninteresting and that we pull this explanation out too often.</description>

      <description>On Friday afternoon, as has happened a few times, I was asked if I had read Jared Diamond&amp;rsquo;s Guns, Germs and Steel. How could an evolutionary analysis of development accommodate Diamond&amp;rsquo;s thesis?
As Diamond frames his book in the prologue, Guns, Germs and Steel provides an environmental explanation of human development. Diamond states that you could summarise his book with the following sentence:
History followed different courses for different peoples because of differences among peoples&#39; environments, not because of biological differences among peoples themselves.</description>

People tend to hold overly favorable views of their abilities in many social and intellectual domains. The authors suggest that this overestimation occurs, in part, because people who are unskilled in these domains suffer a dual burden: Not only do these people reach erroneous conclusions and make unfortunate choices, but their incompetence robs them of the metacognitive ability to realize it.</description>

      <description>It is a bit over a year since Geoffrey Miller wrote this piece foreshadowing a crisis in conscience by human geneticists that would become public knowledge in 2010. The crisis had two parts: that new findings in genetics would reveal less than hoped about disease and that they would reveal more than feared about genetic differences between classes, ethnicities and race.
Now that we are through 2010 with no crisis (that I was aware of - is this crisis still happening in private?</description>

      <description>The History and Geography of Human Genes has heavily influenced the way I think about human evolution. Even though it is getting old at a time when masses of population genetic data are being accumulated, a flip through the maps depicting the geographic distribution of genes provides a picture that is available in few other places.
It was only a matter of time before some economists grabbed this population genetic data to see whether it could shed any light on economic development.</description>

      <description>Economic theory tells us that trade makes the parties involved better off. Through trade, a person can specialise in the activity in which they have a comparative advantage. A person is better off even if they are trading with someone who is better than them at all activities. This is because the less productive person will still have a comparative advantage in some activities. By specialising, an individual can use income from the activity in which they have a comparative advantage to buy other goods and services.</description>

On first thoughts, I am not convinced about the idea. If anything, the paradigm appears to need a lot more development - although reading Kling&amp;rsquo;s blog posts, he may agree. I felt that many of the stories involved too much hand-waving and not enough empirical backbone to be convincing.</description>

      <description>As I posted a couple of months ago, a higher level of violence in a society may lead women to prefer more masculine appearing men. In such an environment, picking the healthiest appearing male is more important than the level of parental care the woman expects the man to give.
The latest issue of Evolution and Human Behavior has an article examining the link between female preference and violence, with Jeffrey Snyder and colleagues examining whether a woman&amp;rsquo;s fear of crime might be a predictor of her preference for &amp;ldquo;aggressive and formidable&amp;rdquo; mates.</description>

      <description>Most of my interest in the use of biology in economics concerns humans being subject to the forces of selection like any other biological organism. With this starting point, it is natural to use many of the tools, models and methods of analysis that evolutionary biologists use.
But sometimes those models and tools are of value without the biological underpinnings. Evolutionary economics is one area where this is done, with the concepts of selection applied at the level of firms (as discussed in my last post).</description>

      <description>As my research intersects economics and evolution, I have found it inconvenient that the term &amp;ldquo;evolutionary economics&amp;rdquo; is already taken. Evolutionary economics is an area of economics inspired by biological processes, with interactions between firms, industries and institutions examined using evolutionary methods. The economics is evolutionary by analogy.
I find the ideas in evolutionary economics attractive, which is natural given my interest in complex systems, out-of-equilibrium processes and the dynamic, emergent properties of economies.</description>

      <description>An economist typically bases their economic models on an assumption that the economy is composed of agents who gain utility from consumption. From the beginning of the model, they take consumption to be the objective and all decisions by the agents aim to maximise their level of consumption within the budget constraint that they face.
While I recently posted on how most economists&#39; fixation on consumption might be biologically justified, I would like to approach the issue from another angle.</description>

      <description>For several years, I have been relatively convinced that beyond a certain threshold, parenting does not matter. This belief came from two sources. The first was Judith Rich Harris&amp;rsquo;s book The Nurture Assumption in which she effectively argues that the children are socialised by other children, not their parents. The second was the concept that the variation attributable to genetic factors increases as you age (from memory I first read this in Matt Ridley&amp;rsquo;s The Agile Gene: How Nature Turns on Nurture - called Nature via Nurture in Australia).</description>

      <description>Any theory that seeks to invoke human evolution as a factor in the Industrial Revolution needs to deal with how quickly humans can evolve and whether this rate of change is fast enough to be a factor.
I was recently browsing Gregory Clark&amp;rsquo;s web-page for his book A Farewell to Alms and came across a video of a seminar in 2007 involving Clark, Brad DeLong and Tyler Cowen. There were some interesting points throughout the session (and it is worth watching it all) but one interesting point was an argument by DeLong on the pace of evolution.</description>

      <description>Having recently discussed cross-country variation in time preference and the pace of life, I have found it interesting reconciling the conclusions.
Richer countries tend to have residents with lower rates of time preference and a higher pace of life. Wang, Rieger and Hens noted this relationship and showed that pace of life is strongly and positively correlated with propensity to wait, an indication of time preference. The residents of the country where everyone is scurrying around have a higher ability to delay gratification.</description>

      <description>As I described in my last post, there is a strong relationship between the size of cities and the residents’ speed of walking. The larger the city, the quicker its residents scamper from A to B. A number of studies have confirmed this relationship and have broadened the relationship to the speed of other activities (such as betel nuts changing hands quicker in Port Moresby than in rural centres in Papua New Guinea).</description>

      <description>Over the weekend, I listened to a great Radiolab podcast in which Bob Levine was interviewed about the pace of walking in cities. Bob spoke about how people tend to walk faster in larger cities, with this relationship surprisingly consistent. Where does this walking pace comes from. As the host Jad asked, do we make the city, or does the city make us?
The early movers in this area of research were Bornstein and Bornstein, who between 1972 and 1974 went to 15 countries across Europe, North America and Asia and measured the speed of pedestrians.</description>

      <description>In Greg Clark&amp;rsquo;s excellent book A Farewell to Alms, Clark posited that there was only one important event in human history - the Industrial Revolution. Before that time, per capita income was effectively flat, with no discernible trend. That all changed around 1800 AD with the Industrial Revolution. Clark saw the Neolithic revolution and the move to settled agriculture as simply an extension of hunting and gathering and symptomatic of the steadily improving efficiency that had occurred over the previous tens of thousands of years.</description>

      <description>Following yesterday&amp;rsquo;s post on female preference for masculine men, a couple of old articles came to mind.
The first (and I am not sure why this did not come into my head yesterday) is the work by Napoleon Chagnon on the Yanomamo. From his paper Life Histories, Blood Revenge, and Warfare in a Tribal Population:
Studies of the Yanomamo Indians of Amazonas during the past 23 years show that 44 percent of males estimated to be 25 or older have participated in the killing of someone, that approximately 30 percent of adult male deaths are due to violence, and that nearly 70 percent of all adults over an estimated 40 years of age have lost a close genetic relative due to violence.</description>

      <description>Masculine appearance in a man is an indicator of their health, which in turn leads to more viable offspring. On this basis, one might assume that women prefer masculine men. However, empirical research into whether women prefer men with more masculine physical features has not shown the strong positive preference we might expect. While masculine appearance is linked to health, that masculine partner may be less interested in a long-term relationship and be unlikely to provide for the child over the long-term.</description>

      <description>Spurred by this chart, a number of bloggers (such as Robin Hanson and Razib Khan) have asked what was happening around 500 BC to cause the jump in population. Was this an almost industrial revolution (with population in the Malthusian state the primary indicator of the level of technology)?
The data in the chart is based on the low estimate by the United States Census Bureau, which in turn comes from a range of sources.</description>

      <description>Alex Tabarrok has posted on Marginal Revolution a piece on the expansion of &amp;ldquo;catch shares&amp;rdquo; as a fisheries management tool. Under catch shares (also called individual tradeable quotas or ITQs), each fisher owns a percentage of the quota set for the fishery. The fisher can trade the share and it provides flexibility to the fisher about when and how they choose to catch their quota.
The use of catch shares as a method of allocating fishing rights has many benefits.</description>

      <description>As noted by Chris Berg, the Australia Institute has rolled out its annual reminder of Joel Waldfogel&amp;rsquo;s almost 20-year old observation about the wastefulness of Christmas giving. As the gift giver has less than complete knowledge of the preferences of the recipient, the recipient tends to value the gift at less than the amount that the giver paid. The disparity in value represents a deadweight loss.
As for most of the annual responses to the Australia Institute&amp;rsquo;s release (with a special mention for Steven Kirchner&amp;rsquo;s 2009 comparison of Christmas gift giving with government spending), Berg suggests that such spending may not be wasteful.</description>

      <description>With immigration again a hot political topic, Ross Gittins has waded into the debate, with his latest contribution seeking to skewer the economic argument for high immigration. Gittins referred to the Productivity Commission&amp;rsquo;s 2006 report into immigration which found that a 50% increase in skilled immigration could boost GDP by 4 per cent after 20 years. The Commission also predicted that real income would increase marginally, with all the income gains accruing to the new migrants.</description>

      <description>Beliefs come in clusters. If someone believes in action on climate change, they are more likely to support unions, gay marriage and progressive taxation. To me, one strange pair of beliefs is that on peak oil and climate change.
Take this quote by the Australia Institute in Running on Empty? The Peak Oil Debate: As a result of peak oil, &amp;ldquo;skyrocketing oil prices are likely to result in severe disruption to economies, with central banks raising interest rates to slow runaway inflation, people out of work, famine, hunger and serious civil unrest.</description>

      <description>One of the issues at the core of my research is the speed of human evolution, particularly over the last 10,000 years. There are several potential arguments to suggest that the speed of human evolution is increasing, such as a larger population (creating a larger source of mutations) and the huge changes in environment that humans have experienced.
One of the obstacles to this argument is the largely monogamous nature of marriages, especially in more recent times and developed countries.</description>

      <description>In Kevin Kelly&amp;rsquo;s recent appearance on Econtalk, he talked about his new book What Technology Wants. I have not read the book but some of Kelly&amp;rsquo;s statements about human evolution are worth comment.
Kelly notes that, to a degree, humans created our own humanity. Kelly talked about how humans are the first domesticated animal, in that we used our minds to domesticate ourselves. While we are a continuation of the primate line, we have added with our minds things other primates don&amp;rsquo;t have.</description>

      <description>Over the weekend I listened to the three-part Lionel Robbins Memorial Lectures 2010, this year given by Lord Adair Turner.
Lord Turner gives a fantastic and balanced critique of the practice of economics and its use in public policy and regulation of the financial sector. Most refreshingly, he does not end his critique with a demand to regulate and restrict, but rather lays out a range of considerations in setting policy and which arguments he considers should be given most weight.</description>

      <description>In a recent discussion as part of the Cato Unbound series, Matt Ridley suggested that we shouldn&amp;rsquo;t forget the Materialist explanation for the industrial revolution. The difference between the British and other bursts of economic activity, such as that of Ancient Greece, is that the British event did not peter out. The reason for that, says Ridley, is coal.
On one hand, this explanation feels like a Jared Diamond style geographic explanation, although in a more modern era.</description>

      <description>I have a couple of follow on thoughts from yesterday&amp;rsquo;s post on large companies being pressured to donate to charity.
Firstly, I was probably a bit flippant in describing the target donation rate as 0%. If charitable donations are what the shareholders want, so be it. However, the shareholders should make that choice, not external pressure groups. Further, the majority of shareholders should not make that choice for the others. If they want donations made, it should be from their share of the profit.</description>

      <description>The Daily Telegraph has had a go at Australia&amp;rsquo;s top 20 companies for not donating enough to charity. According to their analysis, the largest 20 Australian companies donated only 0.85 per cent of their profits to charity in 2009-10, with ANZ donating only 0.21 per cent. This is less than the 1 per cent deemed adequate by &amp;ldquo;social experts&amp;rdquo;.
I propose a different target: 0 per cent. Those profits belong to the shareholders and ideally, should be in their hands to decide if and how they will donate.</description>

      <description>An article by Anna Goodman and Ilona Koupil in last month&amp;rsquo;s Evolution and Human Behavior found a link between school performance and number of children and grandchildren (in Sweden 1915-1929). This effect, as might be expected, held in males only. The number of children was linked almost entirely to whether the male married, with marriage largely a function of socioeconomic position. As most males married (around 90%), the effect of schooling performance on number of children was largely evidenced in those males at the bottom of the distribution.</description>

      <description>Procrastination bothers me. Not in the sense that I want to procrastinate, but biologically. Why would a tendency to procrastinate evolve?
Even without considering evolution, time inconsistency is a subject of debate in economics. The problem of &amp;ldquo;hyperbolic discounting&amp;rdquo;, in which people rapidly discount events in the near future but discount more slowly for further delay, has been well established in experiments. This also accords with our experience (For an example of hyperbolic discounting, as well as some general thoughts on procrastination, it is worth reading James Surowiecki&amp;rsquo;s recent article).</description>

      <description>Today I listened to an old (2006) interview with E.O Wilson by Michael Novacek (thanks NYAS). Wilson had a few criticisms of economics - the heavy basis in mathematics for one - and he stated that this had come at the expense of building a microeconomic foundation based on evolutionary biology.
He also spent some time on the subject of valuation of diversity and ecosystem services. Much of this is a no-brainer.</description>

I am not sure of the source of the above quote (it has been mentioned several times on Econtalk), but I consider that Stigler was thinking of the wrong field. He should have thought of biology.
An article in the Economist this week noted the increasing use of biology in the study of business and management.</description>

      <description>An ABC news article last week reported a study by Professor John Endler on the use of visual tricks by male bower birds to make themselves look larger to females. By placing small objects at the front and larger objects at the back of their bower, the court in which the male bower bird is viewed appears smaller, which makes the male look larger. Endler noted, however, that it was not clear whether the male had any empathy for the females perspective or if the male simply arranged the objects based on his own preferences.</description>

A debate like this is always going to be at cross purposes. Both history and economics are large fields with differing schools of thought (and battles within). To tar all of economics with the same brush is to ignore the breadth of economics.</description>

Of course Bryan favors rising wealth and falling fixed costs, as do I. But in the meantime he also should admit that a) education &#34;parachuted&#34; in from outside can have a high marginal return, b) collectively stronger pro-education norms raise demand and can alleviate the high fixed costs problem, c) there are big external benefits, some operating through the education channel, to lowering the fixed costs, d) stronger pro-education norms put a region closer to a &#34;</description>

      <description>One of the more interesting pieces of evidence in the nature or nurture debate is the that athletes on professional sports teams tend to have a higher proportion of players born early in the year. Malcolm Gladwell documented this phenomenon for ice hockey players in his book Outliers. The basic idea is that when young, those born earlier in the year are bigger and faster than their peers and, as a result, tend to get more game time, are selected for further development and so on.</description>

      <description>Over the last few weeks, Bryan Caplan of Econlog has engaged in a debate with his former teacher Bill Dickens over the social value of education. Brian&amp;rsquo;s position is that education is largely used for signalling rather than skill acquisition. While some signalling is good (matches students and employers), it is privately optimal to far exceed the social optimal. This excessive signalling consumes resources for limited social return, so we should stop subsidising it and possibly consider taxing it.</description>

This was based on article published earlier in the year (Ronay, R. &amp;amp; von Hippel, W. (2010). The presence of an attractive woman elevates testosterone and physical risk-taking in young men. Social Psychological and Personality Science, 1, 57-64).
I haven&amp;rsquo;t been able to access the article yet, but in the Catalyst story, von Hippel proposed that it could be explained through the role risk taking plays as a signal of fitness.</description>
