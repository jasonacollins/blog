However, in his discussion of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_Five_personality_traits">big-five personality trait</a> of conscientiousness, Miller suggests that high conscientiousness was only selected for after the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neolithic_Revolution">Neolithic Revolution</a>:</p>
<blockquote>In several respects, conscientiousness is an unusual personality trait. Because hunter-gatherer life did not require as much planning and memory for debts and duties as life in larger-scale societies with more complex divisions of labor, conscientiousness may have evolved to higher average levels only recently, and perhaps to a greater degree in some populations than others. Only with the rise of activities like agriculture and animal herding would our ancestors have needed the sort of anxious obsessiveness and future-mindedness that characterize the highly conscientious. Only in the past ten thousand years did our ancestors prosper by continually asking themselves: Have I plowed enough yet? Did I sow the seeds early enough? Is one of the lambs missing? Did my cousin pay me for those olives? Am I teaching my children the skills they will need in twenty years? Thus were born the sleepless predawn ruminations of the middle-aged conscientious.</blockquote>
<p>Economically, conscientiousness is a positive trait (both individually and in the aggregate). While I would argue that other traits would have also faced selection pressures since the Neolithic Revolution, it is probably easier to build a case for conscientiousness evolving in an economically useful manner than for the other big-five traits.</p>
<p>Miller couched most of his discussion in Spent in terms of the big-five (openness, conscientiousness, agreeableness, stability and extraversion) plus general intelligence (the central six as he calls them). Rob Brooks did similarly in <a href="https://jasoncollins.blog/2011/06/brookss-sex-genes-rock-n-roll/">Sex, Genes &amp; Rock &lsquo;n&rsquo; Roll</a>. It&rsquo;s probably not a bad habit to get into, as Miller suggests most of the studies about the heritability of preferences (such as in my recent post on the <a href="https://jasoncollins.blog/2011/05/the-heritability-of-feminism/">heritability of political views</a>) are simply reflections of the central-six. In their favour, the central-six are near statistically independent, apart from a slight correlation between openness and intelligence, and have survived in various forms through several decades of psychological research.</p>
<p>As for the trait I often talk about, time preference or patience, I expect that this is a combination of intelligence and conscientiousness.</p>
