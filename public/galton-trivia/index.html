      <p>Every time a new Francis Galton piece is published, I look forward to the Galton trivia. This time it is in <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/magazine-13775520">an article</a> by Steve Jones (HT: <a href="http://johnhawks.net/weblog">John Hawks</a>):</p>
<blockquote>He made statistical inquiries into the efficacy of prayer - he got  into trouble for that for he found that those people frequently prayed  for, like monarchs, lived no longer than anyone else.
<blockquote>
<p>He even made a beauty map of  Britain, based on a secret grading of the local women on a scale from  attractive to repulsive (the low point was in Aberdeen).</p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>Jones uses Galton&rsquo;s findings on height to lead into his argument that genetics has run into a problem. Geneticists are not finding specific genes for traits that we know are highly heritable.</p>
<blockquote>Take adult diabetes, now a major health problem, and one that  certainly runs strongly in families. Genome scans reveal scores of  different bits of chromosome as possible culprits but together they  explain just one part in 20 of the overall inherited liability to the  disease.
<p>The chance of being born with a predisposition to a common  illness such as diabetes or depression is a gamble with huge numbers of  cards.</p>
<p>So many small cards can be shuffled that everyone who falls ill fails in  their own fashion and no gene says very much about whether or not you  will get the illness (although the number of cheeseburgers you eat  certainly does).</blockquote></p>
<p>While no gene <em>by itself</em> is likely to say much about your chance of getting adult diabetes, Jones&rsquo;s comparison between a single gene and cheeseburgers is not meaningful. We are not composed of a single gene - we have a genome. Despite genetic studies not finding the &ldquo;missing heritability&rdquo;, that heritability still exists. A more useful comparison might be whether family history is a better predictor than the number of cheeseburgers eaten. Or whether your twin has adult onset diabetes.</p>
<p>The other interesting thing about examples like this is that the environmental factor would have a genetic component. A host of heritable traits are likely to affect whether one eats a lot of cheeseburgers. This is one of the reasons why it is not easy to link gene X to a specific outcome.</p>
