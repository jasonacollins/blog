      <p>I am at the <em>Social Decision Making: Bridging Economics and Biology</em> conference (the abstracts of which can be downloaded <a href="https://jasonallancollins.files.wordpress.com/2011/04/social-decision-making-2011-conference-program.pdf">here</a>). As the name suggests, the basic idea behind the conference is to pull  together economists and evolutionary biologists to develop new  collaborations and examine how their respective approaches to social decision-making might be useful to each other.</p>
<p>So far, the most surprising  observation (to me) is how many of the evolutionary biologists are working in  the behavioural economics area and conducting experiments with human  subjects. That is certainly a good thing, as behavioural economics could do with an evolutionary framework.</p>
<p>During the opening presentations there was a slight flavour of &ldquo;bash the economists&rdquo;, but the targets have generally been fair enough - I just wish that individual economists' positions would not be taken to be the entire profession&rsquo;s position. When you consider the evolutionary approaches of the economists whose work has been mentioned, such as <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/2722629">Gary Becker</a> or <a href="http://vimeo.com/8179607">Herbet Gintis</a>, they are poles apart and not necessarily indicative of modern approaches.</p>
<p>The other thing that stands out is that there is little discussion of what economists can offer evolutionary biologists. As is a central theme of this blog, I believe that economics could be much improved by considering humans as evolved (evolving) animals. But what insights by economists should evolutionary biologists be considering in their work that they aren&rsquo;t now? Once you move past methodologies (such as the raft of experimental experience in behavioural economics), I am not sure that I can name a central insight that might have a significant effect on evolutionary biology.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not sure how much I&rsquo;ll be posting during the rest of the conference or over the following Easter break, but I&rsquo;ll be posting on the conference content over the next few weeks.</p>
