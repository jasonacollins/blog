      <p><a href="https://hbr.org/2018/07/if-you-say-something-is-likely-how-likely-do-people-think-it-is">From Andrew Mauboussin and Michael Mauboussin</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In a famous example (at least, it’s famous if you’re into this kind of thing), in March 1951, the CIA’s Office of National Estimates published a <a href="https://www.cia.gov/library/readingroom/docs/CIA-RDP79R01012A000700040015-3.pdf">document</a> suggesting that a Soviet attack on Yugoslavia within the year was a “serious possibility.” <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sherman_Kent">Sherman Kent</a>, a professor of history at Yale who was called to Washington, D.C. to co-run the Office of National Estimates, was puzzled about what, exactly, “serious possibility” meant. He interpreted it as meaning that the chance of attack was around 65%. But when he asked members of the Board of National Estimates what they thought, he heard figures from 20% to 80%. Such a wide range was clearly a problem, as the policy implications of those extremes were markedly different. Kent recognized that the solution was to use numbers, <a href="https://www.cia.gov/library/center-for-the-study-of-intelligence/csi-publications/books-and-monographs/sherman-kent-and-the-board-of-national-estimates-collected-essays/6words.html">noting ruefully</a>, “We did not use numbers…and it appeared that we were misusing the words.”</p>
<p>Not much has changed since then. Today people in the worlds of business, investing, and politics continue to use vague words to describe possible outcomes.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>To examine this problem in more depth, team Mauboussin asked 1700 people to attach probabilities to a range of words or phrases. For instance, if a future event is <em>likely</em> to happen, what percentage of the time would you estimate it ends up happening? Or what if the future event has a <em>real possibility</em> of happening?</p>
<p>Unsurprisingly, the answers are all over the place. The <a href="https://hbr.org/2018/07/if-you-say-something-is-likely-how-likely-do-people-think-it-is">HBR article</a> has a nice chart of the distribution of responses, and you see more detailed results <a href="http://www.probabilitysurvey.com/">here</a>. (You can also take the survey there too).</p>
<p>What is the range of answers for an event that is &ldquo;likely&rdquo;? The 90% probability range for &ldquo;likely&rdquo; - that is the range that 90% of the answers fell within (and 5% of the answers were above, and 5% below) was 55% to 90%. &ldquo;Real possibility&rdquo; had a probability range of between 20% and 80% - the phrase in near meaningless. Even &ldquo;always&rdquo; is ambiguous, with a probability range of 90% to 100%.</p>
<p>An interesting finding of the survey was that men and women differ in their interpretations. Women are more likely to take a phrase as indicating a higher probability.</p>
<p>So what does team Mauboussin suggest we should do? Use numbers. Pin down those subjective probabilities using objective benchmarks. Practice.</p>
<p>And to close with another <a href="https://www.cia.gov/library/center-for-the-study-of-intelligence/kent-csi/kent-vol1no5/html/v01n5p.htm">piece of Sherman Kent wisdom</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Said R. Jack Smith:  Sherm, I don’t like what I see in our recent papers. A 2-to-1 chance of this; 50-50 odds on that. You are turning us into the biggest bookie shop in town.</p>
<p>Replied Kent:  R.J., I’d rather be a bookie than a [blank-blank] poet.</p>
