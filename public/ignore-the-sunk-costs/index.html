      <p>Edge has <a href="http://edge.org/conversation/on-kahneman">a great set of short notes</a> by various authors on how Daniel Kahneman has influenced them. It is worth flicking through them all, but excerpts from my two favourites are below.</p>
<p>First, some excellent advice via Jason Zweig:</p>
<blockquote>Anyone who has ever collaborated with him tells a version of this story: You go to sleep feeling that Danny and you had done important and incontestably good work that day. You wake up at a normal human hour, grab breakfast, and open your email. To your consternation, you see a string of emails from Danny, beginning around 2:30 a.m. The subject lines commence in worry, turn darker, and end around 5 a.m. expressing complete doubt about the previous day's work.
<p>You send an email asking when he can talk; you assume Danny must be asleep after staying up all night trashing the chapter. Your cellphone rings a few seconds later. &ldquo;I think I figured out the problem,&rdquo; says Danny, sounding remarkably chipper. &ldquo;What do you think of this approach instead?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The next thing you know, he sends a version so utterly transformed that it is unrecognizable: It begins differently, it ends differently, it incorporates anecdotes and evidence you never would have thought of, it draws on research that you&rsquo;ve never heard of. If the earlier version was close to gold, this one is hewn out of something like diamond: The raw materials have all changed, but the same ideas are somehow illuminated with a sharper shift of brilliance.</p>
<p>The first time this happened, I was thunderstruck. _How did he do that? How could _anybody _do that? _When I asked Danny how he could start again as if we had never written an earlier draft, he said the words I&rsquo;ve never forgotten: &ldquo;I have no sunk costs.&quot;</blockquote></p>
<p>Second, Eric Kandel (an 84 year-old Nobel laureate):</p>
<blockquote>Daniel Kahneman has not yet influenced my work on snails and mice, but I am only in an early point in my career and I still look forward to exploring his ideas in a molecular biological context in the future.</blockquote>
